Format: PU
Overview: While Abra may initially seem like one of PU's top threats thanks to its massive Special, high Speed, excellent Psychic typing, and access to Thunder Wave, the tier is extremely hostile to it, and it's barely viable as a result. Abra is held back by its horrendous physical bulk; despite its base 90 Speed outpacing key threats like Nidoqueen and Gastly, numerous foes such as Scyther, Fearow, Rapidash, Magmar, and Arcanine can outspeed and OHKO Abra. Teams with Abra can use Rock-types to check these faster foes, but they are exploitable and better suited supporting other Pokemon. While not as bad of a matchup, slower physical attackers like Pinsir can also beat Abra one-on-one even if they have to take a hit or paralysis first. To make matters worse, despite Abra's higher Special, the Fire-types actually do more damage to neutral targets due to Fire Blast having a higher Base Power than Psychic. Despite its access to Thunder Wave, Abra's frailty means it fears paralysis more than just about every other Pokemon in PU. One notable paralysis spreader is Drowzee, a foe that both counters Abra and turns it into a liability by threatening to spread status to its teammates. While Drowzee cannot match Abra's Speed and power, its higher bulk and access to Hypnosis gives Abra major competition as a Psychic-type status spreader.
Abra's one saving grace is its fantastic Gastly matchup. Abra outspeeds Gastly, 2HKOes it with Psychic, threatens paralysis against its team if it switches out, and takes minimal damage from Gastly's Psychic and Thunderbolt. Unlike Drowzee, Abra outspeeding Gastly means Hypnosis is far less reliable against it, and once Sleep Clause is active Abra dominates Gastly like no other Pokemon in PU. It puts Gastly in a terrible situation if it doesn't have Drowzee supporting it, letting Abra enable teammates that fear Gastly such as Seaking and Scyther. Gastly isn't the only reason to use Abra, because it does have a few other favorable matchups, such as Nidoqueen and many Porygon variants.
Comments: Other Options
Reflect looks like an enticing option to increase Abra's physical bulk, notably letting it dodge OHKOs from the plethora of Hyper Beam users. However, Abra's lack of reliable recovery and the need for a free turn to set it up makes Reflect difficult to use, especially when many Hyper Beam users outspeed Abra. Additionally, Reflect is useless against Scyther and Pinsir due to Slash, and it can often be useless against common foes such as Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow due to their high critical hit rates. Rest is an extremely niche option that allows Abra to dominate Porygon sets that only have Psychic as an attacking move, though it is useless against every other relevant foe.
Checks and Counters
Faster Threats: Scyther, Fearow, Arcanine, Magmar, and Rapidash outspeed Abra; the former three always OHKO it with Hyper Beam, and the latter two have a very high chance to OHKO it with their own Hyper Beam. Fearow also has a 51.3% chance to OHKO Abra with Double-Edge, and Scyther has a 74.4% chance to OHKO Abra with Slash. However, these threats have difficulty switching into Psychic and hate getting paralyzed.
Psychic-types: Drowzee and Slowpoke resist Psychic and are only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss. Both can paralyze Abra with Thunder Wave, and in return they don't mind Abra's Thunder Wave that much. Drowzee can also 3HKO Abra with Seismic Toss. As a result, both Pokemon can switch into Abra with ease and force it to sacrifice itself or make a teammate risk taking status or a powerful attack.
Physical Attackers: While it's outsped and dislikes being paralyzed, Pinsir is only 3HKOed by Psychic and OHKOes Abra back with Slash. Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave and 3HKOed by Psychic, and it OHKOes Abra with Earthquake 92.3% of the time. Abra outspeeds and 2HKOes Machamp and Graveler, but they can also tank a hit in a pinch and retaliate; the former OHKOes Abra with Hyper Beam, and the latter has a 76.9% chance to OHKO it with Earthquake.
Thunder Wave Users: Thunder Wave users such as Staryu, Porygon, and Dragonair can paralyze Abra and leave it helpless against every physical attacker in the tier. However, they struggle to tank Abra's Psychic and hate being paralyzed themselves.
Moveset: Special Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Psychic serves as Abra's primary attack, and it's very spammable thanks to Abra's high Special and how few Pokemon resist it. Seismic Toss is Abra's strongest attack against Psychic-types like Drowzee, opposing Abra, and the rare Slowpoke. Thunder Wave lets Abra spread paralysis, though it should be used carefully given that the majority of the tier either has a strong physical attack or their own Thunder Wave; many are also more threatened by Abra's Psychic. Thunder Wave is best used when Abra forces something out or when sacrificing Abra is worth paralyzing a foe back, such as against Porygon. Substitute is another tool to let Abra exploit switches, but it still leaves Abra vulnerable to paralysis. Counter can be used instead to punish foes using physical attacks like Body Slam to predict Abra switching out, but Hyper Beam will often OHKO Abra even at full health.
Abra should generally be used as an answer to Gastly, usually switching in after Sleep Clause is active, though it can find switch-in opportunities when Gastly uses a special move against a foe such as Seaking or weakened Nidoqueen or in a double switch against a predicted Gastly switch-in. Once on the field, Abra dissuades Gastly from switching out thanks to its powerful Psychic and Thunder Wave. Even if Gastly survives Abra's Psychic and uses Explosion to trade with it, Abra's team no longer having to worry about such a dangerous threat is generally an advantageous trade. If Gastly ceases to be a concern, Abra has a good matchup against Porygon variants that lack Double-Edge, taking minimal damage from its attacks and threatening paralysis and Special drops with Psychic. Nidoqueen is another foe Abra is adept at taking on, rarely being OHKOed by its Earthquake while outspeeding and 2HKOing it. Omanyte and Graveler are useful partners to Abra thanks to their ability to check the Fire-types that outspeed and usually OHKO Abra, as well as Fearow and Scyther. Notably, they force mind games where the faster threat must decide between using Hyper Beam to OHKO Abra before it can paralyze them or using another attack against the incoming Rock-type to avoid having to recharge. Abra also aids the Rock-types against Staryu, as it easily switches into Staryu's Surf and either paralyzes Staryu or KOes it outright if it has taken prior damage such as if it switched into Graveler's Earthquake. However, Fearow and Scyther can somewhat bypass the guessing game, since they have attacks besides Hyper Beam that can OHKO Abra. Fast threats such as Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Scyther also make great partners, as they can trade hits with their opposing counterparts and overwhelm slower paralysis spreaders for Abra. Scyther is notably appreciative of Abra handling Gastly for it. Sandslash, while rare, is immune to Thunder Wave and 3HKOed by Psychic while it can OHKO Abra back, so Abra must play very cautiously if Sandslash is spotted on the opposing team.

Format: NU
Overview: Abra narrowly edges out Mr. Mime as the strongest Psychic-type special attacker in NU, and its base 90 Speed allows it to Speed tie with Mr. Mime, Moltres, and Venomoth and outspeed much of the tier. This makes it one of the tier's most potent special attackers and revenge killers, threatening notable Pokemon like Nidoking, Venomoth, and Kingler. Thunder Wave lets Abra crucially force out faster threats like Charizard and Electrode, as Charizard can only OHKO it 20% of the time with Hyper Beam and does not want to take paralysis for this chance. Abra can also occasionally turn its physical frailty to its advantage, sending back a near-lethal attack from Clefable or Charizard for immense damage with Counter.
Abra's frailty cannot be overstated, however. Abra is so unfathomably frail that even stray coverage moves like Blastoise's Body Slam and Venomoth's Double-Edge easily 2HKO it; stronger moves, like Kingler, Clefable, and Raticate's Hyper Beam and Kabutops's Slash, are guaranteed to OHKO it. This means it essentially cannot switch into anything and will usually be forced out immediately after any revenge kill. It especially fears Raticate, which easily OHKOes it and is impossible to safely switch into. If Abra faces down a Raticate, it becomes a liability and likely has to be sacrificed. Abra also lacks recovery, so it cannot effectively switch into and check Mr. Mime despite resisting Psychic.
Comments: 
Moveset: Special Attacker
Description: Psychic 2HKOes Psychic-weak foes like Nidoking and Venomoth and 3HKOes most neutral targets bar Moltres. Thunder Wave allows Abra to force out faster foes like Charizard and Electrode as long as it's fully healthy; even slight chip damage gives Charizard an easy OHKO with Hyper Beam, Slash, or even Earthquake. Seismic Toss is Abra's best option against Mr. Mime and helps to 4HKO Exeggcute after using Psychic twice to fish for critical hits or Special drops, which can sometimes allow Psychic to 3HKO it. Counter lets Abra exploit opposing predictions, as the opponent may be reluctant to use Hyper Beam against it, fearing a Rock-type; if Abra manages to catch a Body Slam or similar from a foe predicting this, it can return massive but usually nonlethal damage. Notably, however, it is guaranteed to OHKO Charizard by returning Slash and Kingler by returning Body Slam. Substitute is a rare option Abra may use to fish for paralysis or attempt to catch a foe switching out, allowing it to stay in and continue to fight, potentially even paralyzing the switch-in and fishing for another Substitute.
Abra should always be used alongside Mr. Mime, as Mr. Mime is nearly a strict upgrade. Teams can use them in tandem to spread paralysis and deal massive, near-unresisted damage with Psychic. Such teams are very physically frail, and Abra benefits from an ally like Golem that can absorb physical attacks and especially Hyper Beam attempts before firing back. Abra also enjoys allies that really want Mr. Mime out of the way, like Kingler, which can also switch into Charizard for it. Abra can work well as a lead, trading paralysis and using Seismic Toss against Mr. Mime or paralyzing Charizard and landing one more hit in the vast majority of cases. This frees up allies like Mr. Mime, Charizard, and Blastoise to trade hits with other threats or clean up later. Abra can be used outside of being the lead, in which case it appreciates support from teammates that can spread paralysis, such as Venomoth and Clefable, as well as assistance in checking faster threats, such as from Golem, which checks Charizard and Electrode. Abra is hard to fit in this role, however, and often requires giving up Pokemon like Charizard or using an excessively frail team that can be punished by threats like Golem and Electrode.

Overview: Aerodactyl finds a niche on defensive teams in Ubers for its ability to completely stonewall standard Mew and Snorlax sets as well as some variants of Tauros thanks to its unique Rock / Flying typing. Once it sets up Reflect, it takes negligible damage from even a +6 Mew Body Slam. Aerodactyl is also gifted with an exceptional base 130 Speed, which gives it a sky high 25.39% critical hit rate and ties it with Jolteon and Mewtwo as the second fastest Pokemon in the game.
However, Aerodactyl's flaws massively outweigh its benefits. Its damage output is mediocre at best, struggling to threaten strong special attackers such as Mewtwo and Slowbro even on a critical hit, while it gets 2HKOed or 3HKOed in return by most special attacks; this lets Mewtwo and Slowbro switch in with little issue. Aerodactyl also cannot meaningfully threaten physical attackers outside of trying to burn them with Fire Blast, which is extremely risky, as it risks accidentally burning a special attacker switching in. Aerodactyl's movepool is extremely shallow, forcing it to run Double-Edge as its main attacking option, and recoil combined with stray hits from Mew and Snorlax wears it down quickly. This chip damage will eventually force it to use Rest, and while it may be able to do so safely against standard Mew and Snorlax, it's forced out by strong special attackers, such as Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Starmie. Once forced out while asleep, Aerodactyl has difficulty getting back in safely due to its frailty and passivity.
Comments: Other Options
Fire Blast can be dropped within reason, as it has a mere 8 PP and will rarely ever burn its intended target, instead usually burning a special attacker that can shrug off the chip damage and block other status later on. Fire Blast is also completely useless in front of a paralyzed Mew, as Aerodactyl cannot burn it anymore. Sky Attack can be used, as it is Aerodactyl's only way of doing meaningful damage to bulky foes, as a critical hit Sky Attack does 79.2% minimum to Mewtwo and 72.7% minimum to Slowbro. However, Sky Attack is extremely exploitable due to the charge turn. Mimic can be used to attempt to copy a useful move from Mew, such as Swords Dance, Soft-Boiled, Thunder Wave, or Body Slam. However, Mewtwo and Slowbro can still switch in with little issue. Wing Attack has a whopping 56 PP, which, in combination with Reflect and Double-Edge, gives Aerodactyl 112 spare PP to slowly stall out Mew and Snorlax.
Checks and Counters
Mewtwo: Mewtwo switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with little issue, taking negligible damage from even a critical hit Double-Edge while forcing Aerodactyl out with the threat of a 2HKO from any of its special attacks. If Mewtwo gets burned by Fire Blast, this allows it to block other status later on. Mewtwo only has to fear a critical hit Sky Attack, which does 79.2% minimum to it.
Slowbro: Slowbro, much like Mewtwo, switches into all of Aerodactyl's attacks with ease and threatens it out with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from Surf. Slowbro does have to fear a critical hit from Sky Attack though, as it takes 72.7% minimum and, unlike Mewtwo, is slower than Aerodactyl and lacks immediate recovery.
Ice-type Moves: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from all Ice-type moves from the likes of Tauros, Chansey, and Amnesia Snorlax. Amnesia Snorlax can be a major issue for Aerodactyl, as Aerodactyl is OHKOed by a +2 Blizzard, preventing it from fulfilling its role as a Snorlax check.
Electric-types: Electric-types, such as Zapdos and Jolteon, deal significant damage to Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt, with Zapdos even having a 46.2% chance to OHKO it, whereas Zapdos takes negligible damage in return from Double-Edge and does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Jolteon Speed tying Aerodactyl means Aerodactyl can't attempt to break through it with critical hits, as it risks getting KOed by Thunderbolt after recoil from Double-Edge.
Gengar: Gengar is immune to Aerodactyl's Double-Edge and is only 6HKOed by Fire Blast, while it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt in return, although getting burned by Fire Blast limit's Gengar's longevity as a pivot. Burn also halves the power of Gengar's already middling Explosion. Gengar also has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.
Starmie: Starmie forces out Aerodactyl with the threat of paralysis and a 2HKO from any of its super effective coverage moves, while Aerodactyl can only 4HKO it with Double-Edge; however, Starmie has to fear Sky Attack, as it's OHKOed by a critical hit.
Rhydon and Golem: Rhydon and Golem both 2HKO Aerodactyl with Rock Slide and take next to no damage from Double-Edge and Fire Blast; however, they have to be wary of getting burned by Fire Blast, as a burned Rhydon or Golem is effectively decommissioned.
Non-standard Mew: Uncommon Mew sets, such as Rock Slide Mew, special attacking Mew, and Transform Mew can catch Aerodactyl off guard; +6 Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Rock Slide even with Reflect up, and special attacking Mew 2HKOes Aerodactyl with super effective moves and 3HKOes with Psychic. Special attacking Mew also does not fear burn from Fire Blast. Transform Mew stalls Aerodactyl out of PP over time.
Moveset: Defensive Wall
Description: Set Description
The combination of Rest + Reflect lets Aerodactyl comfortably switch into most Mew and Snorlax sets as well as Tauros lacking Blizzard. Aerodactyl can take up to 5 Body Slam hits from a +6 Mew and 11 Body Slams from Snorlax once it sets up Reflect, so it can use Rest very safely. This lets Aerodactyl stall these foes out of attacking PP, as it can switch in repeatedly to shut them down offensively; special attackers like Mewtwo and Slowbro will usually switch in, so Aerodactyl needs to be partnered with teammates that can switch into them consistently, such as Chansey, Slowbro, and Soft-Boiled Mew. Reflect is imperative on Aerodactyl, as without it, it can be broken through with ease by Mew carrying Body Slam. Snorlax and Tauros lacking Blizzard can also give Aerodactyl issues if it lacks Reflect. With paralysis from Body Slam and Tauros's 21.48% critical hit rate, Tail Whip Tauros can also break a chipped Aerodactyl quite easily if it lacks Reflect.
Aerodactyl's main attacking move is Double-Edge, as it does serviceable damage to less bulky foes. However, Double-Edge deals poor damage to bulkier foes such as Mewtwo and Slowbro, which threaten it back with strong special attacks and paralysis. Fire Blast has a 30% chance to burn the foe, incapacitating physical attackers such as Mew, Snorlax, and Tauros. However, Aerodactyl has to be wary of burning foes such as Mewtwo and Starmie, as the burn damage is negligible to them and lets them switch in and block other status later on.

Format: UU
Overview: Aerodactyl is able to find a niche on anti-Wrap cores thanks to its exceptionally high Speed, which allows it to check and revenge kill even some of the fastest Pokemon in the tier, like Dugtrio and Persian. This Speed gives it an incredible 25.39% critical hit rate while also making it difficult to pin down with Wrap. Aerodactyl also has an amazing defensive typing that provides it with immunity to Earthquake and resistance to Normal-type attacks, granting it great synergy with physically frail Pokemon like Electabuzz and Raichu. Finally, Aerodactyl's Normal resistance allows it to PP stall Wrap, dissuade Explosion, and force recharges from Hyper Beam.
However, Aerodactyl comes with a slew of problems. It's hindered severely by a lack of STAB options, with its sole semi-functional one being the mediocre Sky Attack. This extends to the rest of its offensive movepool, often leading Aerodactyl to use Fire Blast. Overall, these movepool issues limit Aerodactyl's damage output by quite a bit. Furthermore, its reliance on Double-Edge forces it to take heavy recoil and leaves it susceptible to knocking itself into KO range, severely limiting its defensive use throughout a game. Defensively, Aerodactyl is very frail specially, taking massive damage from Surf and Blizzard, both very common attacks in the tier. As a result, it will struggle against threats like its extinct brethren Omastar and often get forced out. Aerodactyl is extremely reliant on its Speed as well, making paralysis a near-death sentence, once again forcing it out if it can't KO the user before it gets paralyzed. This is further amplified by the risk of Body Slam paralyzing it, which makes what would otherwise be a switch-in opportunity a dangerous game to play.
Comments: Other Options
Aerodactyl's fourth move slot is the most expendable, and while its movepool is very limited, this isn't to say there aren't options. Rest is the most relevant option, allowing Aerodactyl to serve a more defensive role while removing paralysis, ensuring it can maintain a defensive presence throughout a game. Considering Wrap deducts sleep turns, Rest plays well into Aerodactyl's playstyle. However, Rest also makes it easy setup fodder for Dragonite. Alternatively, Sky Attack can be used to hit Haunter and OHKO Kadabra, which isn't unfeasible if it's charged during a Recover turn in Kadabra's case, but its two-turn nature and shaky accuracy make it unreliable and specific.
Checks and Counters
Rock-types: Aerodactyl can't scratch Rock-types at all—especially Omastar and Golem—and is weak to almost every attack they commonly use. As a result, Aerodactyl invites these threats in just by existing and will be subsequently forced out.
Haunter: Haunter is immune to Aerodactyl's main attacking options and takes minimal damage from Fire Blast. As if this weren't enough, it 2HKOes Aerodactyl with Thunderbolt. The best Aerodactyl can offer against it is a potential burn, which makes its Explosion pitifully weak. However, Haunter must be wary of Sky Attack.
Water-types: Aerodactyl takes heavy damage from any viable Water-type's STAB Surf. While it can survive Surf from Vaporeon at full HP, Double-Edge's recoil means it will almost never be in a situation where it can make use of it. This also makes Tentacruel's 28.2% chance to OHKO Aerodactyl with Surf much more imposing. Gyarados can 2HKO Aerodactyl with Surf or Thunderbolt or even OHKO it with Hydro Pump 89.7% of the time. However, Aerodactyl is very capable of revenge killing Water-types not named Omastar through Hyper Beam.
Paralysis: Aerodactyl's main strength in RBY UU is its Speed, so paralysis is the bane of its existence. It will force Aerodactyl to use Agility to remain in control, assuming it is running it, which can be very difficult to set up reliably and leaves it open to exploitation from Pokemon like Dragonite. Unless Aerodactyl can take out opposing paralysis inducers like Electabuzz and Hypno, it's forced to switch out. It should be noted that they're KOed by Hyper Beam from 47.1% and 37.5% onwards, respectively. Raichu can notably use Agility to outspeed Aerodactyl and 2HKO it with Thunderbolt. Electrode can do the same, and its naturally higher Speed makes matters worse. Body Slam's paralysis chance can also make checking Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio much riskier than it should be, making what would normally be a valid point of entry a potential death sentence.
Articuno: Articuno takes middling damage from Aerodactyl's options outside of Fire Blast, can boost itself to become faster than it through Agility, and OHKOes it with Blizzard. If Articuno has used Agility, Aerodactyl can't do anything.
Dragonite: While a Toxic or even burn from Aerodactyl will completely stuff its chances of a Wrap sweep, Dragonite is more than capable of beating Aerodactyl. It can use Agility to outspeed and 2HKO Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Thunderbolt, and it doesn't take much damage from its attacks. It also has access to Thunder Wave, which incapacitates Aerodactyl and makes it much more vulnerable to Wrap.
Moveset: Speed Utility
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Double-Edge acts as Aerodactyl's main attacking move, allowing it to deal significant damage to physically weak Pokemon. Double-Edge notably 2HKOes Kadabra and puts Dugtrio into range for Hyper Beam. Hyper Beam allows Aerodactyl to revenge kill opposing Pokemon very effectively, KOing Tentacruel from 40.2% onwards. Fire Blast is most useful for the significant burn chance, which can incapacitate physical attackers and cause Wrap users to take more damage than they can deal when using it. Toxic can be used to prevent a Wrap sweep from Agility + Wrap Dragonite, but Agility is helpful for ignoring the Speed drop from paralysis. Fire Blast works well with Toxic, as burning Haunter and Tentacruel—which are immune to it—allows your own Tentacruel to further chip them using Wrap.
Aerodactyl's main purpose during a game is to revenge kill Pokemon and prevent Wrap cores from making progress, all while providing defensive support through its typing. This is best facilitated by the use of partners that, like Aerodactyl, take minimal damage from Wrap, such as Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon. Alternatively, Aerodactyl can be fit onto teams with offensive Pokemon that can give it openings to sweep like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dragonite. Overall, this culminates into a hit-and-run playstyle that makes it work well, be it early- or late-game.
Aerodactyl's resistance to Normal-type attacks and high Speed mean it can switch in on Wrap with near-impunity, taking minimal damage while guaranteeing damage on the opposing Wrap user should Aerodactyl stay in. Aerodactyl also happens to switch in well against Pokemon that use their teammate's Wrap to switch in freely, such as Dugtrio and Persian. This makes it a good response to these switch-ins with good prediction, especially if it comes in the same turn as them. Overall, Aerodactyl serves as very effective means to check these fast threats, dictating the game state efficiently by denying the opposing team momentum.
Aerodactyl's Ground immunity makes it well equipped for double switching, allowing it to ease in Electric-types like Electabuzz, as well as Haunter and Tentacruel, through deterring the use of Earthquake. This makes Aerodactyl suitable for teams that lead with Electabuzz, as Dugtrio is fairly likely to switch in immediately, and Aerodactyl can KO Dugtrio with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam. Since Aerodactyl is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, it appreciates having a Ground-type teammate like Dugtrio or Golem to switch in on Thunder Wave and maintain momentum.

Format: NU
Overview: Arcanine is a fringe pick in NU as a defensive Fire-type that trades hits efficiently thanks to a very high Attack stat backed by Body Slam access. Being the best physical Fire-type is a big perk for the fiery dog, leaving a dent in anything that doesn't resist its coverage. Its Speed is just barely enough to work, outrunning Pokemon like Venomoth and Mr. Mime, which also makes it a fair anti-lead and revenge killer. Arcanine's bulk is nothing to scoff at, even taking a +2 Earthquake from Charizard, actualizing its utility as a defensive Fire-type. It also has a fantastic Moltres matchup, stonewalling the terrifying Legendary Bird while threatening anything attempting to switch in with a meaty Body Slam. Arcanine can usually deal heavy damage before going down and, when paired with Water-types like Blastoise, can form a decent defensive core to combat the offense-laden RBY NU.
However, metagame shifts have not been kind to the Legendary Pokemon: tier staples like Charizard, Kabutops, and Golem tear into it, as Arcanine only has Fire- and Normal-type moves for coverage, and these Pokemon are frequent offensive presences. While it can theoretically use Toxic to punish them, this is hardly a substitute for direct damage, and lacking Fire Spin to pile on chip damage or escape bad matchups worsens the issue. Without Venusaur as a reliable target for it to switch into, as well as Moltres becoming less favored, Arcanine's regular lines of play have diminished. As a defensive Fire-type, it also has issues distinguishing itself from Rest Moltres outside of its admittedly crucial Body Slam access; while Moltres lacks it, it has more overall bulk, Fire Spin access, and generally inconsequential weaknesses, notably not being hit by Earthquake. Furthermore, while Arcanine's Charizard matchup is functional, it's just that: even minor chip damage, which it will sustain, can drastically worsen it. Due to a mix of these factors, Arcanine has fallen off significantly. The volatile nature of the tier is just a bit too much for Arcanine teams in general, leading to them being a rare sight in the modern metagame.

Arcanine's movepool is workable, but replacing any move often harms more than it helps due to its highly specific matchup spread. Agility can be used to make Arcanine into a mixed late-game sweeper, with its great Attack stat and Body Slam access making it more reliable than Agility + Fire Spin Moltres. However, with its limited coverage, setting the stage for Agility Arcanine can be difficult, and not having Fire Spin means it needs foes to be put in KO range for it to be consistent.
Toxic can be used on lead Arcanine sets to poison potential Fire Spin leads, particularly Charizard and Ninetales, as well as give it something to catch Kabutops and Golem switching in. However, Charizard and Ninetales perform this role better due to their higher Speed and access to Fire Spin. Reflect can be used to further this role and mitigate Arcanine's Earthquake weakness, but the abundance of Swords Dance and Slash users that ignore this makes the utility limited. Leer can be used on paralysis-intensive teams to drop Defense while reapplying the foe's paralysis Speed drop, often forcing the opponent to switch it out, but this is especially niche.
Checks and Counters
Rock-types: Arcanine has nothing to contest Rock-types outside of hoping for a Fire Blast burn, leaving it countered by Golem and Kabutops, which 2HKO it with Earthquake and Surf, respectively. Kabutops is also excellent at making use of a resting Arcanine, as it often uses Swords Dance to threaten a sweep.
Water-types: Arcanine takes massive damage from Water-type attacks, which all 2HKO Arcanine, making Pokemon like Blastoise, Seadra, and Kingler threatening. Kingler strongly dislikes taking paralysis from Body Slam or burn from Fire Blast but can still 2HKO Arcanine.
Charizard: Charizard can 3HKO Arcanine with Earthquake, which becomes a 2HKO if it's taken even minor damage. Swords Dance allows Charizard to exploit Arcanine if it uses Rest; in fact, Charizard coming in on a predicted Rest can end the game on the spot. A healthy Arcanine can mortally threaten Charizard with Body Slam paralysis, though, so this matchup can be volatile.
Setup Sweepers: Once Arcanine uses Rest, it's left vulnerable to exploitation, and most setup sweepers have super effective coverage against it. Kingler, Kabutops, Sandslash, and Seadra are all capable of 2HKOing Arcanine after setting up.
Moveset: Defensive
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
STAB Fire Blast lets Arcanine deal significant damage to Venomoth while serving as its best attack against neutral targets like Nidoking. Body Slam lets Arcanine fish for paralysis as a midground option while denting Fire-resistant foes such as Blastoise and Charizard. Backed by Hyper Beam, Arcanine can 2HKO Mr. Mime if it's taken minimal damage and quickly finish off Fire-resistant Pokemon. Rest should rarely be used but bolsters Arcanine's defensive role, ensuring it can reliably stonewall Moltres, which can't outspeed and chip it down with Toxic + Fire Spin without Agility, and also gives Arcanine a chance to potentially recover in front of a paralyzed foe. However, waking it up can be difficult outside of switching into Fire Spin or weak attackers like Venomoth.
Arcanine can be used as an anti-lead, possessing just enough Speed and power to function. Critical hit Fire Blast OHKOes Venomoth, and Body Slam paralysis against any of Charizard, Mr. Mime, and even rare sights like Primeape can be game-defining. Arcanine's bulk allows it to duel lead Charizard quite well, as usage of Earthquake potentially means taking a hit it can't afford so early into a game. It should be remembered that Arcanine is not 2HKOed by Earthquake. However, Arcanine doesn't always need to be a lead, as it can be a strong mid-game presence thanks to the reliability that its bulk, power, and Body Slam access provide. Its Speed is just right for a revenge killer role as well, crucially outrunning base 90 Speed Pokemon like Mr. Mime that are otherwise quite difficult to bring down when they have the advantage. Teams that use Arcanine primarily use it alongside Blastoise, providing a useful defensive backbone against Charizard. Offensively, Arcanine can potentially allow Mr. Mime to flourish by fending off opposing Mr. Mime and Clefable. Using Arcanine takes up a valuable team slot for a second Fire-type, however; there is very little reason to drop Charizard for Arcanine, and thus teams must find ways to check Water- and Rock-types in spite of this increased weakness.

Format: UU
Overview: Arcanine may be known as the Legendary Pokemon in-game, but in reality, it is largely underwhelming due to its abysmal Fire typing. RBY UU is chock full of bulky Water-types like Omastar and Vaporeon that can switch in and easily suppress Fire-type Pokemon. Tentacruel gets a special mention for being able to outspeed these Fire-types and either deal considerable damage with Surf, or predict a switch and pivot with Wrap. Even among Fire-types, however, it’s tough to justify using Arcanine over Moltres due to its inferior Special stat. Because of these flaws, Arcanine is not recommended for use on competitive RBY UU teams, and thus rarely sees play.
While Arcanine lacks a real niche in the UU metagame, it has a few somewhat desirable traits. Its 95 base Speed and access to Agility lets Arcanine outpace some other Agility users, like Articuno and Dragonite, and it possesses a strong Body Slam to deter switch-ins. This sounds a lot like a weaker Dodrio at first, but what sets Arcanine apart is a powerful STAB Fire Blast and its 30% burn rate, not only threatening the likes of Kangaskhan and Persian, but also letting it deal considerable mixed damage.
Comments: 
Moveset: Agility Sweeper
Description: Set Description
Agility is a great boon to Arcanine due its removal of paralysis’s Speed debuff on top of providing a boost that lets it outpace even a boosted Articuno. The set’s idea is to set up an Agility and then take advantage of Arcanine’s acceptable mixed attacking power while potentially spreading status along the way. Body Slam threatens to paralyze non-Normal-types that would switch in on it and, along with Hyper Beam, makes use of Arcanine’s impressive base 110 Attack. These two moves make a nice one-two punch; if Dugtrio or Kadabra switched in on a Body Slam, then Hyper Beam can dispose of them on the following turn and, therefore, not require a recharge turn. Rounding out the set is STAB Fire Blast, which hits reasonably hard and has a relatively high chance of burning the opponent on hit, which can totally ruin an opposing Tentacruel, Dugtrio, or Kangaskhan.
Arcanine is best mid- or late-game when it can outrun and thus sweep teams, but absolutely requires a team that can scout out and remove Water-types; examples of potential teammates include Venusaur and Electabuzz. Switching Arcanine in as a Pokemon like Hypno uses Rest is a great way to get a free Agility off. Overall, though, it is a very difficult Pokemon to use, and is just not very good in general.

Strategies:

Format: PU
Overview: Beedrill is thoroughly outclassed in RBY PU. At first glance, Twineedle seems usable and its boosting moves look promising, but Beedrill's incredibly poor stats prevent it from contributing to a victory. It is outsped by premier attackers including every viable Fire-type, Abra, Nidoqueen, Pinsir, and Fearow, all of which OHKO it or come extremely close. Beedrill can only effectively contribute by setting up with Swords Dance and Agility, which is nearly impossible to pull off since even the weakest foes 3HKO it. One would think Twineedle gives it a niche against Psychic-types, but Beedrill flops even against the incredibly frail Abra, OHKOing it a mere 25.6% of the time. Meanwhile, Abra OHKOes Beedrill 72% of the time, before accounting for critical hits, and is faster. Beedrill outspeeds Drowzee but isn't even guaranteed to 2HKO it, and Drowzee has a small chance to OHKO back. The ubiquity of Fire-types does Beedrill no favors, as it deals pitiful damage to them and they outspeed and OHKO it, leaving it few chances to even find entry, let alone progress. In short, Pinsir and Fearow are better attackers than Beedrill on any team.
Comments: 
Moveset: Double Dance
Description: Agility and Swords Dance boost Beedrill's stats to respectable levels; should it manage both, it may actually manage to contribute, but this relies on the opponent misplaying. Twineedle has a small chance to OHKO Abra and may 2HKO Drowzee, but it is ineffective against Fire-types, Pinsir, and Fearow. +2 Hyper Beam deals decent damage to most targets but will rarely break through the opposing team; any fully-evolved Pokemon easily survives it. Beedrill can run Mega Drain to hit Omanyte and Graveler, but it 3HKOes at best and both foes still easily defeat it. Beedrill's best hope is for its teammates to spread sleep and paralysis, hopefully also chipping down its many checks. If Beedrill can use Swords Dance once or twice safely and faster foes are paralyzed, it may manage a sweep, or at least heavy damage.

Format: NU
Overview: Mr. Mime and Clefable define RBY NU, but Blastoise is the glue that holds it together. Blastoise is the catch-all check to Fire- and Water-types and the main line of defense against an early Charizard sweep. It's also one of the few Pokemon able to take a hit from Golem, forcing it out immediately with Surf. Blastoise's offense cannot be discounted due to the lack of recovery in NU; even checks like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Electrode hate taking a Surf as they enter, and many switch-ins fear Body Slam paralysis too. Blastoise often ends up serving as a check to itself, since switching in against it is so difficult. Nothing but Electrode can 2HKO Blastoise without a critical hit, allowing it to trade hits effectively with almost any foe, and the threat of Counter makes it difficult for foes to unleash Hyper Beam with impunity, lest Blastoise switch in and punish them.
Blastoise's biggest flaw is its mediocre Speed, which leaves it open to Venomoth entering to put it to sleep. Blastoise is so critical that allowing this is often game-losing, but switching out gives Venomoth even more momentum; this interaction makes it extremely hard to use Blastoise early-game. Even with sleep off the table, Mr. Mime, Nidoking, and Kabutops all outspeed it and will invariably damage it heavily should it stay and fight. Blastoise also struggles to check Kingler and Kabutops; while it easily weakens both into KO range of allies like Charizard or Mr. Mime, losing Blastoise early in the process can make Charizard or Moltres a major threat. Also, once Blastoise has lost roughly 45% of its HP, it's no longer an effective switch-in to unparalyzed Charizard, which can use Swords Dance as it enters and OHKO it with Hyper Beam from this range. Further, Blastoise usually draws opposing Blastoise in, and they tend to trade with each other. Blastoise thus only gets one or two switch-in opportunities per game, but the opponent will pay a price to remove it for their sweepers.
Comments: Other Options
Blastoise has a plethora of niche options that can substitute for Counter or its fourth move. Toxic is a potential response to Charizard's or Moltres's Fire Spin and can also help to defeat opposing Blastoise without risking Counter. Rest allows Blastoise to eternally wall Ninetales and Seadra and can assist in Toxic stalling opposing Blastoise, but using it allows Mr. Mime and Swords Dance users free entry. Rest is best used to secure endgames against foes lacking setup, rather than as a mid-game defensive play. Blastoise may also consider Hydro Pump, sacrificing accuracy for power. It 2HKOes Moltres, possibly 2HKOes Kabutops, and 3HKOes Clefable. Ice Beam over Blizzard guarantees a 2HKO against Exeggcute without risking a miss chance, but it gives worse damage against other targets. Earthquake is Blastoise's strongest attack versus Electrode and the extremely rare Gastly, 2HKOing the former and having a 59% chance to OHKO the latter. Finally, Bubble Beam can drop the Speed of Nidoking or Charizard, and it doesn't forfeit the 2HKO if Surf follows it up, potentially allowing Blastoise to fish for an even better situation with no downside. In an emergency, it may stop Charizard from setting up and sweeping late-game.
Checks and Counters
Thunderbolt Users: Nearly all teams contain a Mr. Mime, which outspeeds Blastoise and 3HKOes it with Thunderbolt if it can switch in safely. Clefable, while slower, has superior bulk, switches safely into Body Slam, and threatens a Thunderbolt 3HKO or Thunder Wave. Electrode's STAB Thunderbolt is a 2HKO with a high critical hit rate, forcing Blastoise out. However, Mr. Mime and Electrode fear Body Slam paralysis and are generally frail, so they're usually only able to revenge kill.
Venomoth: Venomoth outspeeds Blastoise and can easily enter after a KO or switch into Surf. Blastoise is often a team's defensive centerpiece and cannot afford to take sleep early-game, which gives Venomoth a free sleep attempt as Blastoise switches out, compensating for Sleep Powder's shaky accuracy.
Blastoise: Blastoise will often trade hits with its opposing counterpart, which is often a team's only reliable Blastoise switch-in, resulting in one Blastoise being KOed and the other being severely weakened in most cases. Smart prediction with Counter may result in one Blastoise still having significant health left, but in most cases the winning Blastoise can be revenge killed by nearly any foe.
Kingler and Kabutops: Both Water-type Swords Dance users are middling checks to Blastoise, removing it but ensuring their own demise shortly after. However, a trade often suits them, as Blastoise is usually more valuable. Kingler is just bulky enough to use Swords Dance in front of Blastoise and KO or severely weaken it, often leaving a team with no further check to Charizard. Similarly, Kabutops can win the one-on-one fight or weaken Blastoise into KO range of other threats.
Moveset: Bulky Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Surf OHKOes Golem, 2HKOes Charizard, Ninetales, and Nidoking, and deals excellent damage to non-resistant foes. Seismic Toss enables Blastoise to duel opposing Blastoise and Seadra, 4HKOing both. Counter plays off of this interaction and deals 55.4% to opposing Blastoise after a Seismic Toss. It also lets Blastoise send back Charizard's or Kabutops's Slash twice over, heavily punishing anything they switch into, and Counter can return massive damage after switching into Hyper Beam from Kingler, Raticate, or Clefable. Raticate also must fear a Counter on Super Fang, usually forcing it to use Thunderbolt instead. Blastoise's final moveslot is more flexible. Body Slam can potentially hobble Mr. Mime or Electrode as they switch in, or it can gain an advantage versus opposing Blastoise without risking a massive Counter. Blizzard is also a possibility, notably 2HKOing Exeggcute and the occasional Fearow while potentially freezing other foes.
Blastoise is a mainstay of every viable NU team, often forcing opposing Blastoise to trade for it, as few Pokemon can switch into it well. It can function well alongside other Water-types like Kabutops and Kingler, which can assist in fending off opposing Blastoise and Charizard. Golem is a notably good teammate for Blastoise, as it safely switches into Electric-type attacks, can exploit paralysis spread by Body Slam, and helps Blastoise check Charizard. Alternatively, Exeggcute can check Electrode and Mr. Mime after they force Blastoise out, utilizing the opportunity to land Sleep Powder. Electrode can pair surprisingly well with Blastoise, allowing it to play more aggressively, as Electrode can stop opposing Blastoise and Charizard late-game.
Blastoise should only be sparsely used early-game, as opponents can easily send in Venomoth to get a free sleep attempt against it. Once Sleep Clause is in effect, it can come in to stop Fire-types and Golem in their tracks and force a response. This will usually lead to a Blastoise mirror match that removes both from the game or leaves them too weakened to check anything; should the opponent send in Mr. Mime or Clefable instead, Blastoise can happily hit them with Surf on entry, and then it can switch out to blockade Charizard later. If Blastoise gets in on a Slash from Charizard, the opponent also must consider the risk of a massive Counter against their switch-in. If Blastoise remains healthy late-game, it can stop an attempted sweep by Charizard, Moltres, or Seadra and secure victory.

Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Blastoise is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.
<hr>
Blastoise, while having decent stats, is outclassed by the myriad of other Water-types in RBY UU. As a special attacker and tank, it is outclassed by Vaporeon, which has higher HP and Special. As a physical tank, it is outclassed by Poliwrath, which has access to Hypnosis and a powerful STAB Submission. However, Blastoise has higher Defense than Vaporeon and higher Special than Poliwrath, giving it some merit as a mixed tank. Access to Earthquake gives it a powerful coverage move to hit certain targets that most other Water-types cannot. However, Poliwrath also learns Earthquake, and it has a better Attack stat. Overall, Blastoise is generally not worth using over its competition.

Moveset: Bulky Attacker
Description: Surf will deal decent damage to anything that does not resist it. Hydro Pump can be run for extra power that notably allows Blastoise to OHKO Dugtrio, something Surf cannot achieve. However, Hydro Pump’s low PP and shaky accuracy can become problematic in longer games, making Surf usually superior. Blizzard hits many Water-resistant Pokemon hard, dealing huge damage to threats like Dragonite and Tangela. Earthquake gives Blastoise a way to beat Tentacruel, something many other Water-types lack, as well as hitting Electabuzz and Raichu for super effective damage. The final moveslot will normally be occupied by Rest, allowing Blastoise to stick around for much longer. However, Hydro Pump can be run in this moveslot as well, sacrificing longevity for power and flexibility.
The last moveslot is generally flexible, and there are other options that can work. One such option is Counter, so Blastoise can put its great physical bulk to use against an incoming Normal-type attack. Body Slam lets Blastoise provide team support by spreading paralysis.

Overview: Despite its access to the powerful "Double Powder" combination, Butterfree has no place in PU. Its mediocre offenses and lack of decent STAB attacks mean it does pitiful damage despite its access to the excellent Psychic. It's overwhelmed by most physical attackers and 2HKOed by the plethora of Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunderbolt users thanks to its awful Bug / Flying typing. Additionally, while less common, Rock Slide from threats like Graveler easily OHKOes Butterfree. As a fast sleeper, it's completely outclassed by Gastly, which has a much better offensive presence and Speed tier. As a dual status spreader, Butterfree is outclassed by Drowzee, which does more damage and has fantastic defensive utility. Even fringe sleepers like Vileplume and Weepinbell still have more of a use thanks to their niche defensive utility. It is not advised to use Butterfree if your goal is to win.
Comments: 
Moveset: Double Powder
Description: Sleep Powder and Stun Spore let Butterfree spread status quite effectively. Psychic is Butterfree's most powerful attack, and it's serviceable against some threats like Nidoqueen and Machamp. Mega Drain serves as coverage against Omanyte and Graveler, though Butterfree will still lose versus the latter unless it's weakened beforehand. Alternatively, Psywave lets Butterfree deal decent but inconsistent damage to Psychic-types.
Butterfree struggles the most against Fire-types and Fearow, so checks to them like Omanyte and Graveler make good partners. This is particularly important if Butterfree is used as a lead, as these threats are themselves common leads. While most slower threats don't want to face Butterfree before Sleep Powder is used, afterwards Drowzee serves as a strong check that doesn't mind its attacks or paralysis, so wallbreakers like Pinsir and Fearow help out considerably. Butterfree is best used to put a foe to sleep as quickly as possible and then try to spread paralysis before being knocked out. Butterfree can notably switch into slower Earthquake users like Machamp and Graveler and then put them to sleep. However, it must be wary of their other attacks, most of which hit Butterfree super effectively or can paralyze it.

Format: NU
Overview: Fire-types may be disappointing in RBY on the whole, but Charizard completely warps NU around it thanks to its incredibly threatening combination of Swords Dance, base 100 Speed, and Earthquake coverage. It may not be on every team, but every team needs overlapping Charizard checks to avoid getting obliterated if it ever finds a free turn. Terrifyingly, this is not the extent of Charizard's power. It also makes an excellent lead, mixed attacker, and revenge killer, packing options like Fire Blast, Slash, and Counter to cover a variety of situations. Charizard crucially outspeeds Venomoth, serving as the most consistent way to block its entry and prevent it from putting something to sleep, and Mr. Mime, allowing it to revenge kill effectively. It also exploits Fire-type opposition like Moltres, which cannot do much to stop it from setting up Swords Dance and tearing through the enemy team. Earthquake is the real clincher, though; Earthquake hits many would-be Charizard checks well, helping it break through Kabutops and Nidoking and giving it a chance against Golem.
For all these upsides, Charizard is still held back by its lack of physical STAB, mediocre Attack stat, and horrible defensive typing. It's terrifying once it sets up Swords Dance against a worn-down team, but without STAB and with only base 84 Attack, it cannot OHKO most foes at +2. In fact, +2 Hyper Beam only has a 31% chance to OHKO the frail Mr. Mime, so it heavily relies on team support to wear foes down into range. Its weaknesses to Water, Ice, Electric, and Rock allow most foes to hit it super effectively, and its bulk is not good enough to compensate—every prominent Pokemon in NU can 2HKO it except for Wigglytuff, Raticate, and Charizard, and Golem outright OHKOes it with Rock Slide. Additionally, paralysis completely ruins its ability to sweep and revenge kill; it becomes a great sleep blocker when paralyzed but has to hope to switch in safely on Venomoth, which can backfire if it lands a critical hit or Special drop with Psychic.
Comments: Other Options
Charizard can mix and match moves between sets with ease; just about any set can utilize moves like Counter, Slash, and Hyper Beam to secure damage ranges or exploit specific matchups. Counter can, for example, heavily punish opposing Charizard for attacking at +2 or using Slash, and it can allow Charizard to switch into and return a +2 Hyper Beam from Charizard, Kabutops, or Kingler. It can even use Counter on Clefable's Hyper Beam to leave it in range of Fire Blast or Hyper Beam, or it can come in to revenge kill Raticate and use Counter to catch whatever it switches out to. This can be especially devious if Charizard takes paralysis, lulling the opponent into expecting it to switch out. Reflect can be run with Swords Dance to win an arms race with opposing Swords Dance Charizard, blocking even a +6 Hyper Beam. Toxic appears viable with Fire Spin at first, but this is an incredibly inconsistent strategy that leaves Charizard with poor coverage; a single miss usually results in Charizard getting KOed after blessing opposing Pokemon with an easy way to block sleep and paralysis.
Checks and Counters
Paralysis: Once paralyzed, Charizard is limited to sleep blocking and revenge killing paralyzed foes. This is a major problem for Charizard due to its plethora of common weaknesses, mediocre bulk, and inability to KO anything at full HP even after using Swords Dance. If Charizard does take paralysis, its best move is to sleep block Venomoth a few times to delay the opponent from landing sleep, hopefully giving its own team a chance to put something to sleep first. Paralysis often comes at a cost as well, as Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Wigglytuff all take massive damage from Fire Blast.
Water-types: Charizard has a difficult time with Water-types. For starters, they all 2HKO Charizard with their choice of STAB move, but they each have other advantages as well. The ubiquitous Blastoise 2HKOes Charizard and usually survives even +2 Earthquake into Hyper Beam, and it threatens a brutal Counter against Hyper Beam or as Charizard switches out after using Slash or Body Slam. Kingler's impressive physical bulk nearly matches Blastoise's, and it's guaranteed to KO Charizard with Body Slam followed by Crabhammer, letting it fish for paralysis before dealing the coup de grace. Crabhammer also hits Charizard for at least 77%, letting Kingler secure a KO after minor chip from teammates. Both Blastoise and Kingler also survive a +4 Hyper Beam, so Charizard cannot try to reach +4 against them to sweep if they're at full health. Seadra is not quite as bulky, but it has Agility to set up a countersweep, and its Hydro Pump deals a minimum of 78%, allowing it to snipe Charizard similarly to Kingler. Kabutops is the odd one out, as its Earthquake weakness hampers its matchup and makes it a poor check; if Charizard uses Swords Dance or Earthquake as it switches in, it easily wins one-on-one, potentially even setting up a second Swords Dance in front of it before KOing it, but Kabutops can still check a weakened Charizard.
Golem: Golem is only rarely 3HKOed by Earthquake and OHKOes Charizard with Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into even a set-up Charizard and drive it out easily. Golem has a major issue, though; if it gets burned, it becomes setup bait for Charizard, which can use Swords Dance to reapply the burn Attack drop and cut Golem's damage to pathetic levels. After a single reapplication, Rock Slide deals a laughable maximum of 34%, letting Charizard easily continue boosting in front of its hapless foe.
Electrode: Electrode outspeeds and 2HKOes Charizard, and its 27.3% critical hit rate makes it especially terrifying. However, Charizard 2HKOes back with Earthquake, so if Electrode switches into an Earthquake or Swords Dance, it cannot win without a critical hit or luck with paralysis. Electrode can also use Thunder Wave to stop a Charizard sweep, usually suffering an OHKO immediately after
Clefable: Clefable is bulky enough to switch into Charizard and paralyze it in an emergency, even surviving a +2 Hyper Beam comfortably; a +4 Hyper Beam has a 33% chance to OHKO, and the potential for a critical hit lowers these odds further. After paralyzing it, Blizzard 2HKOes Charizard consistently, allowing Clefable to outright win the matchup rather than just weaken it.
Charizard: Charizard can be its own worst enemy. In a Charizard mirror match, either Charizard can potentially run away with the game by boosting to +4 or even +6, so luck can swing the game heavily—Body Slam paralysis, Hyper Beam misses, and Speed tie luck can allow one Charizard to KO the other while taking minimal damage, which can then allow it to take another KO or even end the game in a mid- to late-game scenario.
Moveset: Mixed Attacker Lead
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Charizard is a strong lead that can trade blows well with any typical lead. Fire Blast 3HKOes Mr. Mime and Clefable, and Blastoise—the typical Charizard check—has difficulty switching in early without allowing Venomoth in freely to put something to sleep. Earthquake is Charizard's strongest physical move without drawbacks and provides solid damage into everything except Charizard and Moltres, crucially nearly 2HKOing Kabutops and Nidoking and dealing significant damage to Golem. Body Slam lets Charizard fish for paralysis against Mr. Mime and still 3HKO it by following up with Fire Blast, and it can also paralyze opposing Charizard. It also gives Charizard a chance to hamstring switch-ins like Blastoise and Seadra, but Charizard can instead choose Slash for consistent high damage, notably 4HKOing Blastoise, 3HKOing Mr. Mime without risking a Fire Blast miss, and dealing more damage to Seadra than Charizard's other options. Charizard's fourth moveslot is flexible. Counter helps it against an opposing Charizard lead, allowing it to return Body Slam or Slash for massive damage, especially against Swords Dance Charizard, which tends to attack with Body Slam after boosting to +2. It can also use Slash; Body Slam twice followed by Slash twice usually 4HKOes Charizard while providing good odds to paralyze it, and Body Slam followed by Slash twice efficiently 3HKOes Mr. Mime. Fire Spin is a rarer but still dangerous option, allowing Charizard to pivot around its checks, albeit inconsistently. It notably also wears down Nidoking and Mr. Mime into 2HKO range quickly, potentially allowing Charizard to turn around a desperate game with a little luck if it's able to avoid paralysis until late-game.
This Charizard set can be played in two main ways. It can either trade hits and take down the opposing lead, sacrificing itself to remove a crucial threat like Mr. Mime, or it can land one hit, take paralysis, and flee, which allows it to perpetually block sleep from Venomoth. Usually, Charizard will simply take the trade to remove Mr. Mime, freeing up its teammates, like Venomoth and Mr. Mime, to exploit this. Since Charizard often wins this matchup, it gets KOed after the opposing lead, allowing its team to take advantage of the opposing revenge killer—for example, by sending Venomoth in against slower foes. This also frees up Mr. Mime to deal immense damage later with less fear of taking paralysis. Taking paralysis to sleep block instead enables more methodical play, but it does come with drawbacks; it requires Charizard to switch a teammate into a scary threat, potentially making for a very poor trade, and paralyzed Charizard's switch-ins are fairly predictable and punishable with smart double switching or attacking. Still, blocking sleep can potentially enable much more aggressive play from slower teammates like Clefable, Blastoise, and Golem. If Charizard escapes the lead matchup unparalyzed, it can use its Speed and coverage to effectively revenge kill most foes later on or to chip foes down and pivot with Fire Spin. In the Charizard versus Charizard matchup, Body Slam is the usual choice to weaken and hopefully paralyze it; however, a Swords Dance Charizard can take advantage of this 70% of the time, so switching out to Blastoise is a reasonable move to ensure it can't set up. However, this invites Venomoth in, so double switching back to Charizard afterward may be the correct choice to gain an advantage. Against more unorthodox leads like Wigglytuff and Clefable, Charizard often has no choice but to trade hits, as nothing switches into them well; unfortunately, these are often worse trades for Charizard than other matchups.
Charizard has a few notable options for teammates beyond obvious choices like Mr. Mime, Clefable, Venomoth, and Blastoise. Exeggcute can take advantage of opposing lead Mr. Mime, switching into Thunder Wave before putting it to sleep and acting as a passable sleep blocker against Venomoth. Electrode can deal immense damage if Charizard takes out Mr. Mime, cleaning up the opposing Charizard and Blastoise late-game. Raticate provides another fast option to help clean up or wallbreak, especially if the lead matchup is Charizard versus Charizard, leaving both paralyzed or KOed; Raticate crucially outspeeds Mr. Mime, allowing Charizard to wallbreak recklessly without giving up the ability to revenge kill Mr. Mime. Seadra is a great teammate, as Charizard baits in and weakens Blastoise for it, freeing it up to sweep with Agility.

Moveset: Swords Dance Lead
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Charizard can use a somewhat greedy Swords Dance set as a lead to attempt to exploit an opposing Charizard lead without Swords Dance, boosting in front of it once or twice to possibly end the game before it begins. At +2, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam KOes Charizard, allowing it to boost and attempt to win the matchup while remaining unparalyzed and moderately healthy. Even without Hyper Beam, Body Slamstill enables it to deal massive damage and makes it difficult to switch into. Fire Blast is the usual last move to avoid losing to Venomoth, and it's Charizard's best move against Clefable and deals solid damage to Mr. Mime; however, Charizard may opt for the riskier Hyper Beam to secure the aforementioned 2HKO on Charizard and to potentially deal massive damage after winning the lead matchup.
If Charizard is able to reach +4, it can OHKO most foes with Hyper Beam, even nearly OHKOing Blastoise, allowing it to trade hits incredibly favorably and open up the game for its teammates. This is especially effective against opposing Charizard sets that lack Body Slam or are too quick to use Counter; Slash is a mere 4HKO, easily allowing Charizard to get to +4 and eviscerate the opposing team, and Counter can be predicted by simply continuing to boost. An opposing Charizard with Body Slam, however, is highly likely to paralyze Charizard before it can set up a sweep, having a 51% chance to paralyze it in two attempts and often getting three attempts. The opponent can also immediately switch to Blastoise, which prevents this strategy from gaining traction, but this can be punished by double switching to Venomoth.
This set is entirely sacrificial in nature, seeking to break holes in the opposing team and set its teammates up for success. It heavily relies on landing the Charizard versus Charizard lead matchup; it struggles into Mr. Mime if lacking Fire Blast, usually switching out to an allied Mr. Mime to play the mirror match and remove this threat or switching into Exeggcute to soften the matchup and secure sleep early. Unless the team has an Exeggcute, this means accepting paralysis on Mr. Mime for free, which can immediately create problems. In this case, Charizard acts as a late-game sweeper, seeking an opportunity to return later and set up. Clefable and Wigglytuff are also poor matchups for Swords Dance Charizard, with Clefable especially being difficult; if Charizard has Fire Blast, it can stay in and attack twice, failing to KO Clefable but dealing heavy damage. In rare cases, Charizard may take out the opposing lead but take paralysis in the process, allowing it be act as a sleep blocker against Venomoth later in the match. This is generally more effective if Charizard has Fire Blast. If Hyper Beam Charizard gets the correct lead matchup, it will ideally set up and take out the opposing Charizard then deal upwards of 50% to the next Pokemon to fight it, usually Blastoise or another Water-type, creating holes for allies like Mr. Mime to exploit.
Exeggcute is an effective teammate to improve Charizard's matchup against Mr. Mime and avoid losing too much momentum. Since Hyper Beam Charizard ideally removes Charizard and Blastoise, powerful attackers like Nidoking, Moltres, and Kabutops thrive after a successful lead matchup; Moltres also Speed ties Venomoth, acting as a soft check to prevent it from landing Sleep Powder. Seadra benefits if the opponent sends Blastoise in immediately against Charizard as it uses Swords Dance; in this case, Charizard can simply use Body Slam and Hyper Beam to leave Blastoise at about 10% HP, which allows Seadra to finish it off, check the opposing Charizard, and sweep late-game. Venomoth is likely the least bad switch-in to a lead Clefable, as it still has decent odds to land Sleep Powder even as it inevitably takes Thunder Wave, potentially bailing Charizard out of an absolutely horrendous lead matchup. Fire Blast Charizard has a better matchup spread as a lead, so it may appreciate teammates like Kingler that can sweep in its stead and appreciate it removing or weakening Mr. Mime.

Moveset: Swords Dance Sweeper
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
The classic NU Charizard set is the late-game sweeper, lurking in the back and seeking an opportunity to set up and sweep. Earthquake and Hyper Beam provide perfect coverage: Earthquake handles Nidoking and Rock-types and also deals heavy damage when Hyper Beam would cause a recharge; it also has better accuracy. Hyper Beam provides the most physical damage possible, having a chance to OHKO Mr. Mime at +2 and KOing common neutral foes at +4, barring Blastoise, Kingler, and Clefable. Once these foes are chipped, Charizard can look for an opportunity to revenge kill a heavily weakened foe and instead use Swords Dance on a predicted switch, allowing it to sweep. Ideally, Charizard wants to reach +4, as it is unlikely to clear through the opposing team without taking paralysis otherwise, but this requires weakening Thunder Wave users enough to ensure they won't switch in and weakening Blastoise enough to KO it with +4 Hyper Beam, which luckily only requires about 20% in damage. This is easily dealt by Fire Blast or Earthquake, and even Body Slam makes for a favorable roll to KO it later. Charizard can choose from several options for its final move. Fire Blast provides coverage for Venomoth without needing a boost and is Charizard's most damaging option against most neutral targets, like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Raticate. Body Slam grants a safe midground option to hit Charizard and Moltres or to fish for paralysis. Fire Spin can bring Nidoking and Mr. Mime into range of a +2 attack after just one or two hits, and it's capable of securing chip damage to save a desperate game against other foes as well.
When acting as a late-game sweeper, Charizard relies heavily on setting up a favorable revenge kill that allows it to boost. For example, if Charizard can revenge kill an Exeggcute, Ninetales, or Moltres, it can easily set up Swords Dance as they exit or land an ineffectual attack, and it may even be able to boost again if the opposing check is, for example, a Water-type, which cannot OHKO Charizard without a critical hit nor paralyze it consistently. However, most Pokemon pack Body Slam, so Charizard is always under threat of a sweep-stopping paralysis from foes like Blastoise, Ninetales, and Kingler. Charizard may have to settle for one KO and heavy damage on another foe, which is usually enough to allow its team to win the game. Charizard can also attempt to sweep at +2, allowing it to set up much more consistently; for this to work it needs to first scout for opposing Rock-types, and it needs bulky checks like Blastoise and Clefable weakened into range of +2 Hyper Beam or Earthquake. Electrode can also completely stop a Charizard sweep with Thunder Wave, so it needs to be handled at any cost if Charizard is to sweep.
Charizard appreciates teammates that facilitate good entry points for it to sweep. Sleep inducers like Venomoth and Exeggcute can create an early opportunity by putting a foe to sleep, though Charizard is not really equipped to sweep against Pokemon at full HP. These Pokemon can also spread paralysis to help Charizard out later by giving it a chance to get a second boost in front of a paralyzed foe. Explosion users like Exeggcute and Golem can remove key targets for Charizard or do something even more devious; by using Explosion into a target they will not KO, they can facilitate Charizard's entry against a foe that cannot stop it from setting up. For example, Exeggcute can use Explosion against a target it's just put to sleep, giving Charizard a free boost against a sleeping foe. Fast attackers with good coverage like Nidoking, Raticate, and Kabutops can help spread damage through the enemy team, allowing Charizard to clean up chipped foes later. Moltres can force in typical Charizard checks like Blastoise and Kabutops, allowing it to soften them up for Charizard to finish off later; two hits with Fire Blast puts Blastoise in range of +2 Hyper Beam, and a single Fire Blast on Kabutops gives Charizard a chance to OHKO it with +2 Earthquake.

Format: OU
Overview: Charizard is completely unviable in RBY OU, being outclassed by fellow Fire / Flying type Pokemon Moltres in almost every way. Moltres packs a higher Special stat and Agility, making it a more powerful threat better suited for the OU metagame. Charizard finds itself overwhelmed by common Water-types like Starmie, Slowbro, and Cloyster, and there's very little it can do in return. Additionally, while Swords Dance could make you assume it has some sort of niche, many better Swords Dance users exist such as Kingler, Kabutops, and Sandslash. The only benefits to using Charizard over Moltres are its base 100 Speed, Swords Dance, and Slash. +2 Hyper Beam or Earthquake can threaten most Pokemon, but it's difficult to use Swords Dance due to the omnipresence of Thunder Wave users like Alakazam and Starmie, and being paralyzed makes Charizard's fragility much more apparent. Its weaknesses to common attacking types leave it 2HKOed by Starmie, Slowbro, Zapdos, Jolteon, most Blizzards, and Gengar, as well as OHKOed by Rhydon and Golem. While Charizard is explosive after setting up, it just requires too much support and risk compared to its reward.
Comments: 
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Charizard should be used exclusively as a late-game Pokemon, once Water-types like Starmie have been paralyzed or, ideally, KOed. Charizard's utmost priority is to set up Swords Dance, as it won't be able to KO much without it. Use Swords Dance when given an opportunity or use Fire Spin to pivot out of bad matchups, for example against a predicted Alakazam or Starmie switching in. +2 Hyper Beam KOes most Pokemon after an Earthquake or Slash, with notable exceptions being Snorlax, Exeggutor, and Slowbro. Earthquake threatens Jolteon and Rock-types, which threaten Charizard. Slash gives Charizard immediate power without the need for setup, ignoring Reflect and knocking most Pokemon into range for a +2 Hyper Beam. Fire Blast threatens Jynx, Exeggutor, and Victreebel while scaring Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax with the risk of game-losing burns. However, it risks thawing frozen Pokemon and burning Pokemon that appreciate the resulting immunity to other status effects, such as Starmie. Counter can let Charizard lure Snorlax variants with only STAB moves and Earthquake into effectively KOing themselves, but if revealed without payoff, it becomes useless.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Charizard is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.
<hr>
Charizard is defined by Swords Dance in RBY UU, which, when combined with its near-unresisted coverage in Body Slam and Earthquake, lets it threaten a large portion of the tier once set up. Additionally, STAB Fire Blast lets it immediately threaten teams featuring Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur, which normally perform admirably against teams using staple Normal-types like Persian and Kangaskhan. Plus, it can Speed tie tier-king Tentacruel while threatening significant damage with Earthquake or a burn with Fire Blast, the latter of which severely dampens its Wrap. Thus, Charizard is a fine pick on offensive teams that need a specialised wallbreaker that can spread burns.
However, Charizard's typing is generally not suitable for UU, being weak to some of the most common offensive types in the tier, which makes it much frailer than it lets on. In addition, Charizard suffers greatly from Wrap; AgiliWrap Dragonite shuts it down and can set up on it very consistently, and slower Wrap users force it to choose between switching out and losing Swords Dance boosts or being worn down. In Tentacruel's case, Charizard can potentially win the Speed tie if it stays in, but Surf often causes it to lose if it hasn't set up prior. Because Charizard is reliant on its Speed to succeed, it is also ruined by paralysis, and the threat of this frequently forces it out before it can deal any significant damage.
Comments: Other Options
Charizard has a very wide movepool. Replacing Fire Blast or its fourth moveslot is feasible, though it loses its near-unresisted coverage in the process. This can end up hurting Charizard's matchups against either Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur or Gyarados and Dragonite, both of which are hard to work around.
Charizard can use Fire Spin to pivot out against its checks, making it more versatile and supplementing its offense. This can improve its Dragonite matchup, letting it pivot out to a Pokemon with Toxic, such as Persian. However, the punishment for missing with Charizard can be paralysis, which it can't afford with its wallbreaking role. Worse still, Fire Spin often ends up inviting in checks like Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Vaporeon, which take minimal damage while forcing Charizard out. Other Pokemon tend to make better use of Fire Spin, most notably Moltres, which has higher Special, and Rapidash, which has higher Speed, notably outpacing Tentacruel. Both have access to Agility as well, letting them use the aggressive AgiliSpin combination.
Counter is a fringe option for Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dodrio, all of which have powerful Normal-type STAB moves. Counter is useful if Charizard survives a Hyper Beam to fire back during the recharge turn, which indirectly gives Charizard a switch-in opportunity. Charizard can also use Hyper Beam itself, which is an incredibly strong finisher if one decides to use an even more aggressive set. In fact, Charizard can even 2HKO Vaporeon with +2 Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam. However, this further increases Charizard's reliance on Swords Dance and leaves it without a midground option. Mega Kick is also a valid option for 2HKOing Vaporeon half the time, though its utility outside of this is questionable.
Checks and Counters
Paralysis: Charizard cannot deal with paralysis at all, often being forced out by the threat of it. Without its Speed, Charizard loses its valuable Speed tie against Tentacruel and can be chipped down by Wrap and dispatched with Surf. Kadabra and Electabuzz outspeed Charizard while threatening it with Thunder Wave,making them common switch-ins to Swords Dance attempts. Electabuzz is particularly notable for having STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Charizard. Thus, these Pokemon must be paralyzed—or ideally, removed—if Charizard is to attempt a sweep. Charizard can situationally win if they're paralyzed, as +2 Earthquake OHKOes Electabuzz and has a small chance to OHKO Kadabra. Furthermore, Body Slam paralyzing them on the switch can completely turn the tables on them. Tangela, while being 2HKOed by Fire Blast and disliking burns, can paralyze Charizard with Stun Spore, meaning it should be chipped into KO range. Body Slam users such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, Gyarados, Dragonite, and Vaporeon are also minor ways for Charizard to be paralyzed.
Dragonite: Without Toxic, Fire Spin, or a lucky Fire Blast burn, Charizard can't hinder AgiliWrap Dragonite, thus letting it switch in, set up, and take over the game from there. Furthermore, even non-AgiliWrap variants can threaten Charizard directly with a 2HKO from Blizzard or paralysis from Body Slam, as well as a 2HKO from Thunderbolt with minor chip damage prior.
Water-types: Without switching in on a predicted Rest and setting up, Charizard fails to make an impact against the Water-types of the tier. Gyarados is notable for being immune to Earthquake, only being remotely threatened with a 3HKO from +2 Body Slam, and KOing Charizard with Hydro Pump if it's taken even minor damage. Vaporeon and Dewgong can survive a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake while threatening back with their STAB moves, dealing massive damage. Omastar can OHKO Charizard a quarter of the time with Hydro Pump but takes significant damage from +2 Earthquake. Tentacruel can shut Charizard down with Wrap and deals massive damage with Surf, but +2 Earthquake OHKOes it half the time, making this a matchup it can't really afford to play into due to its high value. Generally, if any Water-type uses Rest and Charizard switches in, it can make use of those free turns to win, but it must KO them by the turn they wake up to not lose momentum.
Aerodactyl: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the entire game to resist the combination of Fire, Normal, and Ground, which makes it effective at revenge killing Charizard. While it can't afford to take a burn, Aerodactyl shrugs off any attack Charizard throws at it while threatening a 3HKO with two Double-Edge uses followed by Hyper Beam. Aerodactyl can also use Toxic on rare Fire Spin variants to cause Charizard to take more damage than Fire Spin deals.
Rock-type Coverage: Dugtrio and Kangaskhan can't switch in on Fire Blast by threat of a burn, but both 2HKO Charizard with Rock Slide. Dugtrio is of particular note for excellently revenge killing Charizard, as it outspeeds it. However, Dugtrio cannot switch in on Body Slam, which may incapacitate it with paralysis. Additionally, if Dugtrio or Kangaskhan has taken damage, Charizard is likely to come out on top with Fire Blast, which has a strong probability to 2HKO both. Golem, while rare, can OHKO Charizard with Rock Slide, but it is threatened with a 2HKO from +2 Earthquake, and Fire Blast burns ruin its valuable Explosion.
Articuno: While outsped and 2HKOed by Fire Blast, Articuno can OHKO Charizard with Blizzard half the time, so Charizard can only really afford to fight Articuno if it has already taken damage. Articuno has ample opportunity to switch in on Earthquake as well, which forces Charizard to either gamble on a critical hit or switch out. In the event Charizard uses Fire Spin, it can chip Articuno down to Fire Blast range, but this will take around seven turns at minimum without critical hits, all of which risk a miss or low Fire Spin duration.
Moveset: Swords Dance Wallbreaker
Description: Set Description
Swords Dance is essential for Charizard to do any significant damage to many foes, as its Attack is initially quite mediocre. Fire Blast is very powerful, 2HKOing Articuno, Venusaur, and Tangela. The burn chance is also highly beneficial for incapacitating resistant Pokemon such as Aerodactyl, Tentacruel, and some Dragonite and Gyarados variants. However, it arguably benefits Persian, which can no longer be paralyzed—and Slash bypasses the Attack drop. Earthquake is Charizard's best chance at beating Tentacruel during the Speed ties. At +2, it OHKOes Electabuzz, Raichu, and Haunter, as well as Tentacruel half the time; it also 2HKOes Omastar. Charizard's last moveslot is largely based on its team, but one of the two choices is crucial for providing near-unresisted coverage alongside Earthquake. Body Slam is a solid fourth move for its paralysis chance, giving Charizard a midground option and having much higher damage output when boosted with Swords Dance. On the other hand, Slash is a near-guaranteed critical hit, making it almost equal to Hyper Beam and thus giving Charizard immediate power; however, it ignores boosts and thus lacks synergy with Swords Dance.
Charizard succeeds as a wallbreaker and is thus an effective punishment for Pokemon using Rest. Most notably, it can switch in on a predicted Rest from Hypno, set up Swords Dance, and threaten up to 51.2% damage with Earthquake. This forces Hypno to either attempt to Rest stall or switch out, both of which are less than ideal situations. Similarly, Pokemon like Omastar fail to wall Charizard if it switches in on their Rests. Despite this, Charizard should not set up without prior scouting, as the mere risk of it setting up often prompts an immediate switch-in from the opponent, which can be anything from a counter to a paralysis spreader, the latter of which makes it little more than death fodder. Charizard is very capable of sweeping late-game once such checks are removed.
Charizard is best used on teams that struggle against those featuring Venusaur and Tangela, which often employ Articuno to set up against a sleeping Pokemon and sweep. Persian makes another excellent partner, being faster than Tentacruel while profiting heavily from the openings Charizard can provide against common defensive cores. Like many Pokemon, Charizard benefits significantly from Hypno, which grants it significant openings with its longevity, paralysis, and sleep. Teams using Charizard should account for its lack of defensive utility: the most it can offer is double switching into Earthquake. Bulky Water-types like Omastar and Dewgong cover its weaknesses very well, being resistant to Ice and Water at once; Omastar particularly benefits thanks to Charizard's immunity to Earthquake. Pokemon immune to Electric also very helpful, coming with the added bonus of limiting the spread of Thunder Wave paralysis. Dugtrio works particularly well, as its Speed and power ensure it keeps momentum after absorbing Thunder Wave. Charizard also tends to draw in Grass- or Water-types that try to check it, allowing Dugtrio to force damage onto them; however, other Pokemon like Aerodactyl and Gyarados can also perform this task admirably. Because Charizard cannot normally deal with Dragonite without a Fire Blast burn, Dragonite checks such as the ubiquitous Tentacruel, Gyarados, Articuno, and Toxic users such as Aerodactyl, Persian, Dugtrio, and Kangaskhan are all viable teammates.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Clefable is generally considered good in the current metagame
<hr>
Clefable succeeds in RBY UU as a strong early-game offensive threat with great unpredictability and versatility, possessing an incredible movepool with Thunder Wave, STAB Body Slam, Thunderbolt, Blizzard, Counter, Sing, and more. With respectable bulk in tow, Clefable will incapacitate many Pokemon in some form before it goes down; this bulk also helps it take Wrap decently well, letting it stay in and punish misses with Thunder Wave in a tight spot. Furthermore, Clefable has coverage for every Pokemon in the tier, letting it fine-tune itself for a team and punish switch-ins if they get paralyzed prior; still, it won't have the right move for every situation at once.
However, because of its low Speed, Clefable often finds itself getting easily worn down by wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite. Additionally, it is near-effortless to revenge kill with strong attackers that aren't normally even fast enough to revenge kill, such as Hypno, and critical hits don't help. This is compounded by a lack of recovery and resistances, causing it to sometimes struggle as a defensive team piece. Because Clefable provides inconsistent defensive utility and not quite elite offensive pressure, it is often outcompeted by other early-game wallbreakers like Kangaskhan. Regardless of this, Clefable pairs well alongside many Pokemon in the tier—particularly other Normal-types, Kadabra, and Articuno—for its support movepool, which backs its offensive pressure extremely well.
Comments: Other Options
Clefable has among the most customizable movesets in the game. Generally, Clefable should always use Body Slam and usually Thunder Wave so it can incapacitate any one foe, but the rest of its moveset is fair game to alter.
Counter is the most notable choice, as Clefable can easily switch in on Persian's Slash and force it out with the threat of Thunder Wave, thereby allowing Counter to massively damage the switch-in. This situation can similarly be applied to Body Slam uses from Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Additionally, switching in on a predicted Hyper Beam can allow Counter Clefable to deal massive damage. Counter is easily played around once revealed, but it only needs to succeed once for Clefable to do its job.
Mega Kick deals more damage than Body Slam and doesn't require a recharge turn like Hyper Beam, allowing Clefable to 2HKO Tentacruel and Hypno, but the accuracy can lead to Clefable taking extra damage that it can't always afford. Sing is a fair surprise option that lets Clefable compress roles on a team, but repeated misses allow foes to wear it down quickly. Rest lets Clefable attempt to stay healthy throughout a game, and the abundance of Wrap can let it burn sleep turns. However, due to a complete lack of resistances, it is difficult to safely wake up against anything but Wrap, often making Clefable less consistent. Furthermore, a sleeping Clefable is ripe for exploitation from the likes of Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Reflect can be used to take minimal chip damage from Dragonite's Wrap, even PP stalling it when combined with Rest. It can also make Clefable more effective against the powerful Kangaskhan and Dodrio. However, it's ineffective against Pokemon that use Slash, such as Persian and Pinsir, and Tentacruel can 3HKO Clefable with Surf, so it can be difficult to fit into sets. Light Screen lets Thunderbolt Clefable muscle past Articuno, cutting off the monumental power of Articuno's Blizzard.
Clefable has a surfeit of additional coverage options that can be situationally justified. Fire Blast 3HKOes Articuno and potentially incapacitates Kangaskhan and Dragonite switch-ins with burns. It can also 2HKO the rare Pinsir, which otherwise has an amazing matchup against Clefable. Thunder or Ice Beam can be used over Thunderbolt and Blizzard, but Thunder doesn't improve Clefable's KO ranges by much and Ice Beam's PP increase fails to make up for its damage output. Submission allows Clefable to 3HKO Persian and is its best option against opposing Clefable, but it has little use outside of this; Dewgong and Kangaskhan are damaged more by Thunderbolt and Blizzard, respectively.
Checks and Counters
Partial Trapping: Wrappers like Dragonite, Tentacruel, and Pinsir wear Clefable down, exploiting its vulnerability to sustained offensive pressure, before switching to a Pokemon that can KO it like Kangaskhan. Dragonite is particularly effective, as its Wrap deals up to 5% per turn. If AgiliWrap Dragonite sets up prior to fighting Clefable, Clefable struggles mightily to stop it, as it fails to OHKO with Blizzard and usually has to resort to Thunder Wave. Tentacruel can gradually choke it out with Wrap before KOing it with Surf. However, Clefable's bulk increases the chance of an eventual miss—and taking crippling paralysis in return. On the other hand, Swords Dance or repeated critical hits can drastically quicken the process. While rare, Pinsir has Swords Dance + Bind, which lets it swiftly bring Clefable down and KO it from around 85% with +2 Hyper Beam; it can also use +2 Submission after even less damage. The similarly rare Moltres chips Clefable down quickly with Fire Spin while dealing massive damage with Fire Blast.
Faster Sleepers: Clefable is slow and used early-game, so it often risks taking sleep. Common faster Pokemon like Venusaur, Haunter, and Hypnosis Hypno often force it to sacrifice itself or switch out. Clefable can't consistently trade with them either; Venusaur is not likely to be 2HKOed by Blizzard, Haunter is only remotely scared by Psychic, and Hypno has enough bulk and special attacking prowess to make the matchup inconsistent at best.
Articuno: Articuno outspeeds and 3HKOes Clefable with its nuclear Blizzard, while Clefable needs Fire Blast or Light Screen to stand a realistic chance in a flat one-on-one.
Rock-types: Omastar switches into Blizzard Clefable, while Golem handles Thunderbolt variants, and both deal heavy damage with STAB moves. While Aerodactyl is Rock-type and shrugs off Clefable without either move, it loses to Blizzard and Thunderbolt alike, making it a non-issue for most Clefable sets. All Rock-types are excellent Hyper Beam absorbers as well.
Bulky Water-types: Vaporeon and Dewgong outspeed Clefable and threaten it with 3HKOs. However, both take massive damage from Thunderbolt in the process, and they become dicey answers if paralyzed. Notably, Dewgong is 3HKOed by Clefable's Thunderbolt itself, and Hyper Beam Clefable can KO Vaporeon after two Thunderbolt uses first. Poliwrath is faster and can put Clefable to sleep with Hypnosis; it also possesses Submission to 2HKO Clefable.
Counter Users: Because Clefable excels when it's using its Normal-type STAB moves, it can take mortal damage from the rare Counter. Pokemon such as Poliwrath, opposing Clefable, Kangaskhan, and Hypno are sometimes seen using the move. A notable way to trap Clefable is by switching one of these Pokemon in on Hyper Beam and using Counter as Clefable recharges.
Moveset: Offensive Utility
Description: Set Description
This set lets Clefable succeed as a strong early-game attacker, providing ample paralysis support while trading with common early-game Psychic-types like Kadabra and Hypno. Because of Clefable's bulk and Thunder Wave, it will typically incapacitate foes in a one-on-one fight. Staying in against repeated Wrap uses before crippling the opposing Pokemon with Thunder Wave is a viable—albeit risky—strategy, as its physical bulk makes it take minimal chip damage. STAB Body Slam deals sizable damage and threatens to paralyze any would-be switch-in. Hyper Beam is very powerful, KOing Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Persian, and even Hypno from around half HP; a critical hit Body Slam prior can often put these Pokemon in range for Hyper Beam.
Clefable's special coverage move should be chosen based on what the team is lacking. Thunderbolt covers Water-types, 3HKOing Poliwrath, Dewgong, and Omastar as well as 2HKOing Gyarados. Blizzard 2HKOes Dodrio, Dragonite, Tangela, and Golem; it is also Clefable's best option for Kangaskhan and Venusaur. Psychic is the best against Haunter, 3HKOing it, though Special drops can improve this. Additionally, it can 3HKO Tentacruel with a Special drop, though Thunderbolt is comparably effective against it.
Clefable can be a difficult Pokemon to bring in, primarily due to its low Speed causing it to get worn down quickly. It's best brought in through Wrap or double switching on Kadabra or Electabuzz, common sights for their Speed and special offense; Kadabra is a particularly big target, as Clefable 2HKOes it with Body Slam. Because they lack the firepower to break past Clefable and it threatens them with paralysis in return, it's easy for Clefable to gain momentum. These Pokemon can be easily drawn in through early-game use of Tentacruel; for instance, leading with Wrap Tentacruel regularly draws Kadabra in right away and gives Clefable a free switch. Clefable can heavily punish Pokemon by predicting Rest—particularly from Tentacruel and Hypno—as it can easily 3HKO both with Body Slam twice followed by Hyper Beam. In respect to Hypno, Clefable is very capable of switching in via Wrap pivoting and denting it enough to the point that it can be traded with. Kadabra, Tentacruel, and, to a lesser extent, Electabuzz are all extremely common early-game Pokemon that can be regularly lured in through your own Kadabra, Tentacruel, or Hypno; Kadabra and Hypno can force Tentacruel to use Rest through paralysis and super effective damage, while Hypno is forced in through prolonged mirror matches. Dugtrio is also a good opportunity for Clefable to come in, as it fails to 3HKO without critical hits and gets threatened with Body Slam paralysis or severe damage from Blizzard. Dugtrio regularly switches in on predicted Thunder Wave uses, so consider double switching to Clefable from a damaged Kadabra, Electabuzz, Dragonite, or Hypno.
Clefable can be used as a lead, as it forces Tentacruel to pivot with Wrap by the threat of Thunder Wave, threatens non-Hypnosis Hypno, and shrugs off Kadabra's Thunder Wave. In the event the opponent is using a slower team, such as one featuring Tangela or multiple bulky Water-types like Omastar, lead Kadabra may even switch out. However, Clefable can often be more threatening outside of the lead slot because of its ability to pummel paralyzed Pokemon, and Pokemon like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, and Kadabra often perform more favorably as leads. Because of Clefable's low Speed, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and the omnipresent Hypno are excellent partners for making it a late-game threat. They also become much more threatening once Clefable has beaten or traded with an opposing Psychic-type. Clefable also strongly benefits special attackers like Articuno, as it normally dents specially bulky Pokemon such as Vaporeon and Kadabra; Articuno can finish them off while taking out physically bulky Pokemon like Kangaskhan. Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Dragonite appreciate Clefable's paralysis support, which makes up for their lower Speed, while being able to wallbreak alongside it. Thunderbolt Clefable is also helpful for Dragonite in particular, as it hits the Water-types that frequently run Blizzard.

Mimic is useful to copy a foe's Recover, but it has little use outside of this, as Clefable has a good enough movepool already. Reflect and Light Screen can help raise your team's defenses. Submission hurts Normal-types if you need Clefable to do that, but it's inaccurate and shorten's Clefable's time on the battlefield.
Checks and Counters
Clefable can't do much to Gengar outside of paralyzing it, and Gengar can hit back with Thunderbolt and Seismic Toss. Snorlax doesn't particularly care about paralysis, and it can hit Clefable with a powerful Body Slam. Clefable's Special is poor, so Zapdos, Articuno, and Moltres are able to use their high Special to tank Clefable's moves and then outspeed and KO it; they do fear Thunderbolt and Blizzard, however. Chansey and Alakazam can try to defeat Clefable in an emergency, but they dislike Body Slam; it doesn't do that much damage to them, but Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam will KO Alakazam and inflict a great deal of damage to Chansey.
Moveset: Status Spreader
Description: The following analysis was produced around 2007. Information contained in the analysis may be misinformative in regards to the current RBY OU metagame.
<hr>
Overview
Clefable is a decent, unpredictable utility Pokemon, but it's not particularly good at anything. Its Normal-type STAB attacks hurt the omnipresent Psychic-types in RBY, and while it can't beat most of them one-on-one, it can still damage them heavily and shuffle Pokemon around with moves like Thunder Wave and Sing.

Description: Body Slam is always a useful attack for its chance to inflict paralysis, and with the STAB boost, it has the potential to hurt some physically frail Pokemon such as Chansey. Blizzard destroys the Rock / Ground types that attempt to wall Clefable, such as Golem and Rhydon, and is a good attack in general in RBY. Hyper Beam is an extremely powerful move to pick off a weakened Pokemon when other attacks can't. Thunderbolt can hit some Water-types, such as Starmie and Slowbro, moderately hard, while Thunder Wave is a more reliable move than Body Slam for spreading paralysis. The fourth moveslot is the most flexible, as Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave can be replaced by any of the myriad of options Clefable has if you would like to cover a different set of threats.

Description: This set attempts to distribute status problems effectively. Thunder Wave is the most reliable paralysis-inducing move and is especially effective alongside Blizzard to hit the Ground-types that are immune to Electric-type moves. Sing can be used to induce sleep, but its 54.7% accuracy leaves something to be desired. Alternatively, Counter can bounce back physical attacks, particularly the very common Body Slam, to inflict some good damage off Clefable's decent HP. Thunderbolt complements Blizzard well for type coverage by hitting the Water-types that resist Ice-type attacks. On the other hand, Thunder can sometimes OHKO Gyarados and 2HKO Starmie, but it has low accuracy.

Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Dewgong is generally considered less viable in the current metagame.
<hr>
Overview
Dewgong’s main role in RBY UU is being the third-best purely bulky Water-type Pokemon. In terms of raw bulk, Vaporeon is simply the strongest choice. The second most prominent purely bulky Water-type Pokemon is Omastar, which holds on to relevance thanks to a resistance to Normal-type moves. Additionally, other Water-types with more diverse movepools, like Tentacruel and Poliwrath, also give Dewgong some competition.
The two main features that make Dewgong notable are its Ice typing and superior Speed relative to other Water-type Pokemon. Being an Ice-type gifts Dewgong an impressively strong STAB-boosted Blizzard. Despite Dewgong having lower Special than its closest competitors, its Blizzard tends to deal more damage than anything they can throw out. Just a few significant calculations include a possible 3HKO against Hypno, a very likely 3HKO against Gyarados, a 2HKO on Kangaskhan, and a guaranteed OHKO against Dodrio and Dragonite. The Ice type also improves some of Dewgong’s specific matchups. Most notably, Dewgong is the hardest Articuno counter available, as it is uniquely 4x resistant to Blizzard, cannot be frozen, and forces Articuno to take heavy recoil damage over time from using Double-Edge. Dewgong’s Speed is a relevant advantage primarily because Dewgong is able to outspeed and pressure Hypno, which other Water-type Pokemon may struggle with. The Speed and freeze immunity also help Dewgong when it faces other bulky Water-type Pokemon, namely Vaporeon.
Despite these advantages, Dewgong is held back simply because its bulk is not as good as that of Vaporeon and Omastar. Poliwrath also largely surpasses it in physical bulk. Dewgong’s matchups against stronger attackers, both physical and special, simply do not compare to its competitors. As an example, Electabuzz will always 2HKO Dewgong with Thunderbolt but can only 3HKO Vaporeon. Dewgong does not have the longevity it needs; thus, it exists mainly as a niche pick, filling slots only on teams that truly demand its particular blend of strengths and can afford its shortcomings.
Comments: Other Options
Dewgong lacks significant other options. It has other physical options like Headbutt and Hyper Beam, the former of which may be useful on teams focused on spreading paralysis, but it lacks the offensive presence to take full advantage of these moves. Other Pokemon, like Poliwrath, have much better physical attacks at their disposal and the Attack stat to back them up.
Checks and Counters
Thunderbolt: While every major Thunderbolt user in the tier is 3HKOed or better by Blizzard, Dewgong would prefer to avoid the interaction if it can. Electabuzz and Raichu claim 2HKOs with Thunderbolt and boast high critical hit ratios to make the move even scarier. Gyarados and Haunter can consistently 3HKO Dewgong, allowing them to easily revenge kill Dewgong or KO it while it is asleep. While it has no business switching in, Dragonite can also finish off a weakened Dewgong with Thunderbolt.
Rock- and Fighting-type Moves: Dewgong’s weakness to Rock-type moves is a small but noticeable disadvantage when comparing it to other Water-type Pokemon. While neither is likely to win a clean head-to-head interaction with Dewgong, Kangaskhan and Golem claim a possible 3HKO and guaranteed 2HKO, respectively, with Rock Slide. Dewgong also has more trouble switching into Dugtrio, as both Earthquake and Rock Slide deal significant damage. Fighting-type Pokemon and moves are very rare in RBY UU, but they still can give Dewgong some trouble when they appear. Poliwrath that carry Submission are the most notable threat, as they have an 87.1% chance to 2HKO Dewgong while taking very little from all of Dewgong’s moves.
Partial-trapping Damage: Due to its largely inferior bulk, Dewgong does not stomach chip damage, especially from Wrap, very well. Tentacruel and even Dragonite can use Wrap to gradually whittle down Dewgong’s health and quickly put it into range of most fast attackers. Dewgong is worse at taking Wrap and hoping for a miss than Vaporeon and especially Omastar. While Fire Spin is not particularly common, it is worth noting that Dewgong does not resist it and is thus not a reliable check to Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres.
Venusaur: Venusaur outspeeds Dewgong and can deal over 60% damage with Razor Leaf or put it to sleep with Sleep Powder. Blizzard is obviously a frightening prospect for Venusaur, but Venusaur is the best Dewgong revenge killer in the tier and can win one-on-one if necessary.
Moveset: Defensive
Description: Set Description
STAB Blizzard is one of the main reasons to use Dewgong. It is Dewgong’s strongest attack and deals remarkable damage to most non-resistant targets. Surf can hit a small pool of Pokemon harder than Blizzard and has near-perfect accuracy, which makes it a wise choice to finish off weakened targets. Ice Beam may seem redundant with Blizzard, but it can be useful in matchups against other Water-type Pokemon, for it gives Dewgong the potential to freeze them without wasting precious Blizzard PP. Body Slam is used to help spread paralysis; paralyzing common switch-ins like Tentacruel and Vaporeon can be quite useful long-term. Thanks to Dewgong's slightly higher Attack, its Body Slam also does more damage than that of Vaporeon and Omastar. For reference, the move is likely to 3HKO Kadabra. Finally, Dewgong carries Rest to improve its longevity. While not quite as defensive as others, Dewgong can still attempt to use Rest and subsequently wake up in front of Water- and Ice-type Pokemon. Switching in amidst Wrap turns is another good option to potentially burn sleep turns.
Dewgong’s primary role is as a defensive piece. It can work as a mixed wall in a similar fashion to Vaporeon, albeit a frailer one, that can slow down offensive momentum from strong attackers like Dodrio, Persian, Kangaskhan, and, of course, Articuno. Dewgong has some offensive prowess as well. Dewgong is surprisingly good at breaking Hypno, as it outspeeds and can 3HKO with Blizzard. Likewise, most major attackers simply do not want to take STAB Blizzard. Generally, Dewgong is most valuable mid- to late-game. This way, Dewgong’s best matchup can be identified and it can be deployed accordingly. For example, it may be useful to determine if your opponent has an Articuno before you let Dewgong take on a physical attacker or attempt to freeze an opposing Water-type Pokemon.

Pokemon: Ditto

Learnset List:

Transform

Strategies:

Format: Uber
Overview: Ditto is frankly a terrible Pokemon in Ubers; however, it holds a nanoscopic niche, as it can switch into paralyzed Mew that isn't attacking and threaten to transform into it, usually forcing it to switch out to a more passive teammate, such as Chansey or Mewtwo, dispelling any boosts it may have. It can also attempt to PP stall Mewtwo, Slowbro, and Chansey. However, it can't PP stall effectively because the first two are extremely hard to switch into once Ditto runs out of PP itself, and the latter 3HKOes Ditto with Seismic Toss due to its HP not changing after it's transformed. Ditto takes on the reduced Speed stat of the paralyzed Pokemon it's transforming into even if it isn't paralyzed itself. It also uses its own stats when landing or receiving a critical hit, making it extremely weak to them. Ditto is completely crippled by paralysis, and its niche of forcing Mew out is done far better by other Pokemon, such as Exeggutor, Zapdos, and Aerodactyl. Ditto doesn't do enough damage with any Amnesia boosts it may copy, and it doesn't have enough PP to stall adequately.
Comments: 
Moveset: Blob
Description: Ditto can attempt to switch into paralyzed Mew that is using Swords Dance or Soft-Boiled and threaten Transform, which can force Mew out and remove any boosts it has acquired. It can also be used to stall out more passive threats such as Slowbro, as it can use Rest to remove paralysis. Ditto is much more threatening if the opponent is using an Explosion spam team, as it can transform into a Pokemon with Explosion to become actually threatening. It requires paralysis support to effectively fulfill the little niche it has, so the likes of Exeggutor, Thunder Wave Mew and Mewtwo, and Chansey can make good partners for Ditto. Ditto should preferably be kept hidden until Mewtwo, Chansey, and Slowbro are KOed, as these are its best switch-ins that prevent it from being threatening. If it is being used to stall, Ditto necessitates teammates that can switch into Mewtwo once it runs out of PP, such as Light Screen Chansey, Slowbro, and one's own Mewtwo. The easiest way to eliminate these foes is with Explosion users, making the likes of Snorlax, Self-Destruct Mewtwo, and Explosion Mew good teammates.

Format: PU
Overview: The novelty of Ditto being the only non-Uber that has access to Transform quickly wears thin when it's the only move it can learn. Ditto's awful base stats are a massive hindrance—it's outsped by the majority of the tier and has subpar bulk, so it generally takes heavy damage before being able to do anything. To add insult to injury, even after using Transform Ditto retains its terrible base HP and low critical hit rate, and it uses its subpar original stats when calculating critical hits it deals and receives. Transform copying stat boosts is almost completely irrelevant in PU, as the tier has few viable setup sweepers. Ditto is a fun gimmick, but if you have the slightest interest in winning, you should never use it.
Comments: 
Moveset: Transformer
Description: Transform is the only move Ditto can learn. It copies all of the target's stats except HP, as well as all of their stat changes. It leaves Ditto with 5 PP in every move, which isn't a huge issue in a tier as offensive as PU, but leaves Ditto easy to PP stall by threats such as Porygon. Ditto appreciates its targets being paralyzed, as then it can transform without taking a hit, which likewise means it should avoid getting paralyzed as much as possible.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Dodrio is generally considered good in the current metagame.
<hr>
Dodrio is a decently fast threat in RBY UU, notably Speed tying with Tentacruel and Raichu, and possesses great STAB options in Body Slam and Drill Peck. These traits and its amazing Attack stat make for powerful and frequent critical hits; the resulting 19.53% chance makes it a very volatile threat that's difficult for most Pokemon to switch into consistently. Dodrio can further boost its Speed and make up for Speed drops from paralysis through Agility, which has the added bonus of making it more difficult to pin down with Wrap. Its typing is also notable for its immunity to Earthquake and paralysis from Body Slam. These qualities make Dodrio a solid revenge killer and late-game sweeper on offensive teams.
However, Dodrio's defenses are extremely poor, making it take heavy damage from even neutral hits and easy to OHKO. Worse still, it lacks coverage moves, leaving it stonewalled by Rock-types like Golem and Omastar. Dodrio is a common target for paralysis due to its Speed and fragility too, making it very easy to neuter. As a result, getting Dodrio into the fray can be a difficult task without support from Wrap or smart double-switching.
Comments: Other Options
Dodrio's movepool doesn't leave much in the way of options. Substitute can allow Dodrio to take a bigger hit than it should, but it is limited in utility, as it doesn't block status in RBY. It also doesn't play to the hit-and-run playstyle Dodrio should be employing, fails to stop it from being forced out by Rock-types that resist its STAB moves, and makes it easier to revenge kill due to the move's HP cost.
Checks and Counters
Rock-types: Dodrio gets completely walled by Golem and Omastar, as it lacks any attack that can deal even neutral damage. In return, they 2HKO Dodrio with Rock Slide and Blizzard, respectively. For similar reasons, Dodrio struggles to offensively threaten Aerodactyl, though most Aerodactyl sets despise possible paralysis from Body Slam much more than Golem or Omastar.
Articuno: Articuno's bulk tends to allow it to take enough hits from Dodrio before it OHKOes with Blizzard. In addition, if Articuno uses Agility, Dodrio can't touch it at all unless Blizzard misses.
Dewgong and Vaporeon: Both of these Pokemon beat Dodrio one-on-one but take heavy damage in the process. Dewgong can outright OHKO Dodrio with Blizzard, and Vaporeon can survive a Body Slam and subsequent Hyper Beam to KO Dodrio with Blizzard if it has taken any prior damage, dealing a maximum of 92.2%.
Electabuzz and Raichu: Both of these threats can either paralyze Dodrio or 2HKO it with Thunderbolt; should Dodrio have taken any chip damage, it will be KOed outright. However, neither can switch in safely due to Body Slam's power and paralysis chance. Plus, even if they switch in on Drill Peck, Hyper Beam has a good chance to KO afterwards. Raichu tends to have even more trouble switching in than Electabuzz because it only Speed ties Dodrio, making the matchup very inconsistent.
Dragonite: Dragonite takes Body Slam and Drill Peck very well at full health, unless Dodrio lands a critical hit, and can then paralyze it with Thunder Wave.
Moveset: Physical Sweeper
Description: Set Description
Body Slam allows Dodrio to spread paralysis while hitting quite hard, 2HKOing fragile threats like Dugtrio and Kadabra. Drill Peck complements this excellently, 2HKOing Haunter, Tangela, and Venusaur, though in Tangela's case Dodrio may have to take Stun Spore to KO it. Dodrio's Hyper Beam is extremely strong, KOing even bulkier threats like Tentacruel and Hypno after a Body Slam on the switch. Finally, Agility is put in the last slot to allow Dodrio to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame. Should it be forced to take paralysis, Dodrio can also use Agility to ignore the Speed drop from it.
Dodrio, as mentioned before, is extremely frail and dislikes paralysis, so it shouldn't be brought into a game early except as a lead. Lead Dodrio can be used to threaten Tentacruel and Kadabra right out of the gate, usually putting them into range for Dugtrio to KO them after Dodrio goes down. This can be huge, as Pokemon like Tentacruel and Hypno otherwise put immense pressure on teams throughout a game. However, this often means sacrificing Dodrio, which may not be favorable in the long-term. Generally, outside of the lead slot, Dodrio should play a hit-and-run playstyle before cleaning up late-game. Dodrio's two main points of entry are opposing Earthquakes and revenge killing. Its Hyper Beam is notably likely to finish off threats dented by a teammate's Explosion. Dodrio's immunity to Earthquake is especially helpful for double-switching out to Electric-types, reducing risk, and maintaining momentum. This immunity can also be utilized alongside Haunter, with its immunity to Normal-type attacks forming a small immunity core. However, repeatedly switching between them can lead to an early KO with a good prediction from the opponent. Dodrio is also good for taking advantage of threats in a passive state, such as foes using Rest, where it can set up with Agility, outspeed every Pokemon in the tier, and tear the opposing team apart with its immediate offensive presence. Furthermore, Dodrio can set up against Dugtrio or weakened physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Persian, as it forces them out with its powerful offensive capabilities. On top of that, forcing these attackers out isn't even required, as Dodrio will gladly take a hit if it means KOing the opposing Pokemon and potentially ending the game outright.

Overview: Being extremely fast and hitting as hard as Snorlax, Dodrio can be a frightening foe in RBY OU, acting as a strong revenge killer and late-game sweeper. Its offensive prowess is no joke, with Body Slam + Hyper Beam 2HKOing many Pokemon in the tier, including Chansey and Starmie. With STAB Drill Peck under its belt, Dodrio has the potential to even OHKO Exeggutor with a critical hit, as well as play around Counter users like Chansey. When used alongside Tauros, Dodrio is very capable of tearing holes in the opposing team that can leave it ripe for exploitation from its teammates.
However, Dodrio is by no means a standard, and there are many reasons why. For starters, it is extremely frail, struggling to even stomach neutral hits and being OHKOed by Zapdos, Articuno, and even Cloyster. This fragility, combined with paralysis incapacitating it, makes it very difficult to utilize outside of late-game scenarios, which many teams will struggle to facilitate. Furthermore, similar to Zapdos, Dodrio is completely hopeless against Rhydon, getting effortlessly stonewalled. Finally, like many Normal-type attackers, Dodrio is strictly outclassed by Tauros, which possesses superior coverage and Speed; ergo, Dodrio must be used alongside it. Overall, while it has merit, Dodrio's flaws make it difficult to recommend for conventional RBY OU teams.
Comments: 
Moveset: Agility Sweeper
Description: Dodrio is fairly straightforward, aiming to simply deal as much damage as possible while not sustaining damage or paralysis itself. Body Slam makes Dodrio extremely difficult to switch into, with the paralysis chance ruining faster Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie while leaving them wide open to a KO the following turn. Drill Peck allows Dodrio to duel Gengar and Exeggutor far more effectively; it also does not enable Counter, which lets Dodrio scout users like Chansey while not losing any offensive pressure. Hyper Beam can potentially OHKO Jynx and Alakazam, as well as secure 2HKOs on Chansey and Starmie in tandem with Body Slam. With critical hit Hyper Beam, Dodrio can 2HKO any Pokemon in the tier barring Rhydon after a Body Slam. Finally, Agility allows Dodrio to outrun the entire unboosted metagame, giving it a more secure late-game sweep, while bypassing the Speed drop from paralysis.
Dodrio's movepool is quite barren, but it has some niche options worth exploring. While it doesn't protect from status in RBY, Substitute is a viable choice to scout for free turns, such as the opponent switching or full paralysis, allowing Dodrio to stomach harder hits than it otherwise could. However, Substitute's HP cost makes Dodrio much easier to revenge kill later, cutting into its already poor bulk. Mimic is a serviceable option, giving Dodrio a potential coverage move like Earthquake to better handle Rhydon, but is extremely unreliable.

Overview: Dragonair has a small niche in the tier as it fits onto Wrap teams thanks to its unique typing and access to Thunder Wave and Wrap; it forces paralysis onto fast foes such as Starmie and Alakazam thanks to these traits—which allows it to chip down and force out slower paralysis absorbers such as Chansey—while shielding its stronger teammates such as Dragonite and Victreebel from paralysis. Dragonair's unique mono-Dragon typing gives it useful resistances to Water- and Electric-type attacks. However, Dragonair's base stats are atrocious; it barely threatens anything offensively and is 2HKOed or 3HKOed by most neutral hits. Its weakness to Ice-type attacks also exacerbates Wrap teams' weaknesses to Ice-type attacks even further. Dragonair is also extremely hard to fit on teams; even dedicated Wrap teams usually only include Dragonite and Victreebel, as these teams are more reliable than teams with three or four Wrap users, which are the teams Dragonair fits on.
Comments: 
Moveset: Wrap
Description: Dragonair's main purpose is to land Thunder Wave on fast Psychic-types such as Alakazam and Starmie to enable Wrap from its stronger, more versatile teammates. Wrap allows Dragonair to force paralysis past slower common paralysis absorbers, such as Chansey. It also allows Dragonair to pivot out of uncomfortable situations to one of its teammates safely. Blizzard is Dragonair's most versatile coverage move; it hits Flying- and Grass-types such as Zapdos and Exeggutor for super effective damage, as well as 2HKOing Rhydon. Blizzard is also Dragonair's best option to finish off weakened foes. Thunderbolt is Dragonair's strongest move against Water-types, 3HKOing Cloyster and Starmie. Hyper Beam allows Dragonair to meaningfully threaten and finish off physically frailer foes such Chansey and Alakazam, doing 37.4% minimum to the former and 48.2% minimum to the latter. Agility can be used in favor of a secondary coverage move, as it allows Dragonair to spread chip and paralysis across the opposing team and not just become a useless sacrifice after it becomes paralyzed. Dragonair can also use Agility against foes that do not carry paralysis-afflicting moves, such as Rhydon.
Dragonair wants to be used early-game to get paralysis off on faster threats as soon as possible, as the Wrap teams it fits on live and die by their ability to paralyze these foes. Dragonair can hit the field safely either by being pivoted in on Wrap from one of its teammates or by coming in after one of its teammates has been KOed. It can also switch in on a predicted Recover. After Dragonair becomes paralyzed, if it lacks Agility, the best use for it is to enable its other, more powerful Wrap teammates by being used as a sacrifice or a pivot.

Format: NU
Overview: Dragonair is a niche threat in NU buoyed by a single, oft-maligned move: Wrap. Combined with Agility and Thunder Wave, Dragonair has the speed control necessary to spam Wrap, wearing down an entire team for allies like Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Raticate to finish off. It can also use Wrap to bully the opponent into accepting paralysis on more Pokemon, chipping down paralyzed foes that try to block Thunder Wave. It supplements this with excellent coverage to finish off weakened foes if they switch in as Wrap misses, forcing the opponent to accept a KO or switch into moves like Blizzard and Thunderbolt. While Dragonair is relatively frail, it does have an excellent defensive typing. It resists the tier's many Fire-, Water, and Electric-type attacks, and only Clefable, Nidoking, and Seadra typically run Ice-type coverage, though Blastoise sometimes does as well.
Dragonair is, however, held back by its relatively poor Speed, need for a setup turn to paralyze the foe or use Agility, and Wrap's tenuous accuracy. Its Speed falls short of threats like Nidoking and Seadra, which both run Blizzard and can 2HKO it; additionally, if not using Agility, Dragonair is incapable of outspeeding Nidoking to use Wrap on it without paralysis support from allies. Opposing paralysis spreaders like Mr. Mime and Venomoth outspeed Dragonair, and Dragonair is also slower than Kingler and Blastoise, which can attempt to paralyze it with Body Slam, as well as Kabutops, which can deal huge damage with Slash. Dragonair has difficulty finding a setup turn for Agility, often relying on dodging Body Slam paralysis or accepting heavy damage and a chance for a critical hit from Blizzard users to set up, leaving it in OHKO range should it miss a single Wrap. Paralysis is also terrible for Dragonair even if it uses Agility, as this reduces Wrap's already shaky success rate to a downright awful 63.75%, ensuring it will fall shortly after. At its best, Dragonair can spread paralysis to multiple foes or chip the opposing team for massive damage, allowing allies to clean up, but it needs to dodge a lot of bad luck to contribute adequately.

Moveset: Wrap
Description: Wrap is essential for Dragonair to control the enemy team, forcing paralyzed foes, as well as Clefable and Exeggcute out to avoid retaliation. If using Thunder Wave, Wrap allows Dragonair to force the opponent to send in an unparalyzed Pokemon, giving Dragonair the option to chip it, paralyze it, or pivot to an ally safely. With Agility, Wrap becomes the ultimate chip-spreading tool, forcing the opponent to hope for Wrap to miss at the right time to punish with paralysis or Blizzard. Dragonair's last two moves are typically Blizzard and Thunderbolt to provide coverage, allowing it to finish off chipped foes or exploit Wrap misses against targets at low HP; Blizzard ensures it can hit Golem and Nidoking, while Thunderbolt hits Water-types and particularly Kabutops, which otherwise can absorb Wrap well. However, other options are possible, such as Hyper Beam to more effectively finish off neutral targets, such as Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Venomoth, or using Agility and Thunder Wave in tandem, giving Dragonair flexibility in its speed control at the cost of coverage.
Dragonair benefits from teammates that can spread status, like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Venomoth, as these allow it to use Wrap without any setup. Venomoth is especially notable, since Sleep Powder provides a safe switch-in for Dragonair, and the opponent may not immediately switch after taking sleep due to fear of Stun Spore. This allows Dragonair to fish for Thunder Wave on an incoming foe or simply set up Agility and begin accruing chip damage. Electrode can help to spread paralysis and create an opening with Explosion, or it can clean up after Dragonair, but using both creates a large weakness to Nidoking. Dragonair's chip damage is ideal for allowing fast allies like Charizard, Raticate, and Nidoking to clean; Charizard falls just short of KOing many foes with +2 Hyper Beam, and Wrap easily bridges that gap, whereas Raticate needs no setup to repeatedly fire off a powerful STAB Hyper Beam, taking out many foes from about 50% of their HP. Nidoking lacks the power of the other two options but makes up for it in excellent coverage, tearing through weakened and paralyzed teams easily.

Format: PU
Overview: Dragonair is a versatile support Pokemon in PU that carries a unique defensive typing, a wide array of coverage moves, powerful utility in Thunder Wave and Wrap, and the ever-present threat of AgiliWrap. While it's outclassed as a support Pokemon by Drowzee and Porygon and outclassed as a damage dealer by anything with a good STAB move, its sheer versatility allows it to surprise foes and force them to accept paralysis or chip damage on Pokemon they may have preferred to save for later. Dragonair's base 70 Speed notably puts it ahead of Seaking, allowing it to wear down Seaking with Wrap. This also enables it to check slower foes like Drowzee and Porygon as well as paralyzed foes, forcing paralysis onto the opposing team or forcing in Nidoqueen to scare out Dragonair, as other Ground-types are too slow to do so. Notably, Dragonair's Dragon typing allows it to resist Fire Blast, Surf, and Thunderbolt, making it an excellent pivot and a huge threat to Fire-types as well as Water-types that don't carry Blizzard, allowing it to check Rapidash, Arcanine, and often Staryu. Dragonair can carry super effective coverage for these foes in return, 3HKOing the Fire-types and 2HKOing Staryu; it can also paralyze them and potentially use Wrap to chip them down if it avoids paralysis itself.
Dragonair has several flaws that hold it back, including its relative frailty, middling Speed, and Ice weakness. It also has some difficulties with prediction, as using Thunder Wave as Nidoqueen comes in can be a disastrous loss of momentum. Nidoqueen outspeeds Dragonair and threatens it immensely, so Dragonair is usually forced out if it hasn't already set up Agility. Gastly also stonewalls Wrap and forces Dragonair to fight it with relatively weak special moves, but it's heavily threatened by Thunder Wave, which leaves it vulnerable to Earthquake users later in the game. Dragonair's typing provides no STAB, making its damage output poor against neutral targets such as Gastly and Porygon as well as rare foes like Pinsir and Machamp. Paralysis also holds Dragonair back significantly, limiting Wrap and forcing it to trade hits with stronger, bulkier foes; this makes it hard to fight fast Thunder Wave users like Staryu and even Abra. Finally, Dragonair is extremely limited in moveslots; it wants all of Agility, Thunder Wave, Wrap, and several coverage attacks, but it can only either fit all of the utility moves and a single attack, or it can fit two attacks at the cost of Agility or Thunder Wave.
Comments: Other Options
Agility can be dropped to fit an additional coverage move, but this sacrifices a lot of potential chip damage and utility, so it should not be done lightly. Hyper Beam has a small chance to OHKO Abra and deals high damage to Staryu and Drowzee, but Thunderbolt already covers Staryu, and none of these three take Wrap hits well. This also leaves Dragonair even more helpless against Gastly and risks a recharge turn if used recklessly. Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir, but this is too niche of a matchup to cover over others, and both Thunderbolt and Blizzard already cover Scyther, a more relevant threat.
Checks and Counters
Gastly: Gastly outspeeds Dragonair, takes no damage from Wrap, and takes little damage from Dragonair's attacks, allowing it to interrupt Dragonair with Hypnosis. However, Dragonair is often content with landing Thunder Wave on it to make it fodder for teammates like Nidoqueen, and it can use Wrap to pivot out and bring in allies that handle Gastly better, making it risky for Gastly to stay in and blockade Wrap. Dragonair lacking Thunder Wave is utterly helpless, however, and relies on teammates to bait out and remove Gastly first.
Paralysis: Paralysis severely hampers Dragonair, making Wrap horribly inconsistent and limiting it to setting up Agility and scoring some chip damage. This is not completely horrible in matchups where Dragonair has super effective coverage, but when it doesn't, it contributes very little damage before falling.
Burn: A burn heavily limits Dragonair by making Wrap a losing proposition, forcing it to simply look for paralysis and chip damage from its special attacks before it falls.
Nidoqueen: The near-omnipresent Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Dragonair while being immune to Thunder Wave; even Blizzard, Dragonair's strongest option against Nidoqueen, rarely 2HKOes it. Dragonair can potentially set up Agility against it, but Blizzard leaves it in range of many attacks should it miss one Wrap.
Blizzard Users: Staryu rarely runs Blizzard, but it threatens paralysis to stop any Agility plays and can then 2HKO Dragonair if packing Blizzard. Seaking and the rare Omanyte can also punish Wrap misses with Blizzard for massive damage.
Fast Physical Attackers: Fearow, Scyther, and the rare Pinsir outspeed and can 2HKO Dragonair, making setup costly, as one Wrap miss ends Dragonair's rampage. Pinsir is also not weak to any of Dragonair's common moves.
Moveset: Support
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Dragonair's moveset is incredibly diverse, but all Dragonair sets tend to focus on supporting its team via chip damage and paralysis. To this end, Dragonair nearly always runs Wrap, which helps to chip down foes, pivot teammates in safely, and forces paralyzed foes to switch out, preventing them from blocking Thunder Wave. Agility should be on most Dragonair sets, making all of its moves far more threatening; after Agility, it outspeeds the entire tier, allowing it to inflict a fearsome amount of chip damage with Wrap and win one-on-one against a variety of threatening foes even without Wrap, including Arcanine, Rapidash, and Fearow. This also partially insulates Dragonair against paralysis, allowing it to cancel the Speed drop and threaten foes with paralysis and super effective coverage. Dragonair usually runs Thunder Wave to spread status, allowing it to disable and use Wrap against faster foes without reliable ways to inflict paralysis, such as Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow. It may also choose to sacrifice itself in certain scenarios to paralyze a threat like Staryu or Agility Porygon, allowing teammates to more easily remove them. Agility synergizes surprisingly well with Thunder Wave, allowing Dragonair to present more of a threat and force in foes that would rather not take paralysis, like Gastly and Staryu, to try to slow them down with status. It also allows Dragonair to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis to foes with Agility. Surf is the attacking move of choice for Dragonair using Thunder Wave, as its combination of PP and coverage fits well with speed control and Wrap. Surf 3HKOes Arcanine, Rapidash, Magmar, and Nidoqueen; OHKOes Graveler; and deals decent damage to most targets. Anything that can handle Surf bar Gastly is unlikely to enjoy taking repeated Wrap hits. Thunderbolt can be substituted over Thunder Wave to improve Dragonair's coverage, 2HKOing Staryu, usually 2HKOing Fearow after Double-Edge recoil, and 3HKOing Seaking. Blizzard is an uncommon option that helps Dragonair do more damage to Nidoqueen and Fearow as well as covering for less common foes like opposing Dragonair and Vileplume, but this costs it super effective coverage against the highly threatening Fire-types and adds little compared to Surf or Thunderbolt.
When running only one attack, this set often works as an anti-lead to the common Arcanine, threatening to paralyze it and use Wrap to force it out as well as threatening Agility should Arcanine try to pivot to Nidoqueen to block Thunder Wave. In this role, Dragonair is a sacrificial Pokemon looking to spread paralysis and chip damage, particularly to Gastly, to allow teammates to follow up against neutered foes. Surf helps Dragonair to fight common leads like Arcanine and Nidoqueen, and Dragonair happily trades Thunder Wave with Staryu and Porygon should they attempt to stop it. Once it paralyzes these foes, they become fodder for slower attackers that would otherwise struggle, such as Nidoqueen and Seaking. Agility helps to force Gastly to block Wrap, allowing Dragonair to paralyze it and either take sleep, or, with a 47% chance, dodge Hypnosis and use Wrap to pivot out while denying sleep. In this role, Dragonair benefits heavily from teaming up with Nidoqueen, which OHKOes Gastly and 2HKOes Staryu but struggles against them due to their superior Speed and super effective moves. It is also effective at enabling allies like Agility Porygon, Seaking, and Scyther by paralyzing and wearing down foes that would otherwise give them trouble.
Dragonair run outside of the lead more commonly have two attacks for coverage, most often forgoing Thunder Wave to act as a scary Agility sweeper that can soften up entire teams for its allies or even win outright. In this role, Dragonair seeks to set up against a foe without a consistent way to paralyze it—such as a Fire-type, non-Blizzard Seaking, or even Nidoqueen— and use Wrap to wear foes down. The biggest benefit of expanded coverage is that Dragonair can punish the use of chipped Pokemon to tank Wrap; on a Wrap miss, it can punish with an attack, which is especially deadly against frail foes like Fearow and Staryu. In this role, Dragonair works well with allied sweepers and cleaners that need slight damage to enable them. For example, Scyther comes just shy of OHKOing a number of foes at +2, and a few hits from Wrap easily make up the difference. Similarly, moderate chip damage helps enable allies like Rapidash and Fearow to clean through entire teams. However, this Dragonair lacks Thunder Wave and therefore makes for a poor enabler for slower allies like Nidoqueen that might appreciate paralysis more than chip damage.

Format: PU
Overview: Drowzee's high Special, Psychic typing, and access to excellent utility options in Thunder Wave and Hypnosis make it an effective support Pokemon. Its combination of good special bulk and not minding paralysis too much let it switch into a plethora of special attackers, like Staryu and Porygon, which are some of the best defensive Pokemon in PU. Once on the field, its dual status threatens offensive and defensive Pokemon alike while dissuading other foes from switching in. The ability to cripple and KO top defensive Pokemon makes Drowzee phenomenal at enabling wallbreakers and sweepers like Nidoqueen and Seaking. While it does not like facing offensive foes one-on-one, when Drowzee is at full health it typically forces out common threats like Rapidash, as they are ruined by paralysis. Drowzee isn't passive either—its STAB Psychic hits most targets very hard, notably dissuading Ground-types like Nidoqueen and Graveler from trying to absorb its Thunder Wave.
Drowzee's biggest flaw is its poor physical bulk: physical wallbreakers like Fearow, Pinsir, and Nidoqueen generally have no issue 2HKOing Drowzee, even if they have to take significant damage or paralysis in the process. Drowzee's Speed is another issue, as it only naturally outspeeds Omanyte, Graveler, Porygon, and the rare Slowpoke. Drowzee is thus reliant on its foe being paralyzed to avoid getting overwhelmed and revenge killed, though this is often not an option due to how frequently Drowzee is forced to take paralysis itself. Drowzee's Speed also limits the utility of Hypnosis, as while it can potentially let Drowzee beat just about every offensive check one-on-one, it usually only gets one or two opportunities to fire it off.
Comments: Other Options
Given that Seismic Toss is only used for the mirror matchup and rare Psychic-type foes, it is the preferred move for Drowzee to drop. Counter can punish Normal-type attackers like Fearow and Pinsir, generally KOing them in the process, but their attacks deal so much damage that the slightest chip will often put Drowzee into KO range. Counter still has utility against opposing Drowzee and Abra, as it can counter their Seismic Toss to deal significant damage back.
Checks and Counters
Fearow: Fearow's Double-Edge almost always 2HKOes Drowzee, while its Hyper Beam does 73.3% minimum. While Fearow doesn't enjoy being paralyzed by Drowzee, it can use Agility to negate its Speed drop.
Arcanine: Arcanine can 3HKO Drowzee with Fire Blast and Body Slam while only being 4HKOed by Psychic, barring Special drops. While it doesn't enjoy paralysis, it isn't completely ruined, and many Arcanine carry Rest, which can potentially erase any progress Drowzee makes.
Pinsir: Pinsir outspeeds Drowzee and 2HKOes it with Slash while only being 3HKOed by Psychic, barring Special drops. It does dislike paralysis, however.
Scyther: Scyther 2HKOes Drowzee with Slash and OHKO it with a +2 Hyper Beam while it can only 3HKO back with Psychic. However, Scyther is ruined by paralysis.
Ground-types: Sandslash outspeeds Drowzee, is immune to Thunder Wave, is only 3HKOed by Psychic, and 2HKOes it with Earthquake—OHKOing after Swords Dance—making it one of Drowzee's worst makchups. While Nidoqueen is 2HKOed by Psychic, it can switch into Thunder Wave and outspeed and 2HKO Drowzee with Earthquake.
Faster Sleepers: While rare, Vileplume and Weepinbell outspeed Drowzee and can put it to sleep with their reliable Sleep Powder, though they must watch out for Drowzee's STAB Psychic, which 2HKOes them. Gastly and the rare Poliwag dislike their odds against Drowzee due to their frailty, though in a pinch they can use Hypnosis to try to put Drowzee to sleep; Gastly can also use Explosion, which does a minimum of 67.4%.
Partial Trapping Users: Drowzee's awful Speed leaves it vulnerable to partial trapping users such as Rapidash, Dragonair, and Pinsir, which can wear it down and pivot around it. However, Thunder Wave ruins most of these Pokemon, and generally partial trapping moves will miss before Drowzee is put into KO range.
Opposing Drowzee: Given its resistance to Psychic and it not minding Thunder Wave that much, Drowzee can switch into itself fairly well and proceed to weaken itself in the mirror match, leaving the surviving Drowzee easy pickings for the loser's teammates.
Moveset: Bulky Support
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Thunder Wave is the key to Drowzee's success: it cripples every foe that isn't Ground-type, ruining offensive and defensive threats like Rapidash and Porygon. Thunder Wave pairs excellently with Drowzee's STAB Psychic, which provides fantastic neutral coverage; it also 2HKOes Nidoqueen, the most common Ground-type, and has a 40.7% chance to 2HKO Graveler. Psychic's chance for a Special drop is quite significant, as it can turn 3HKOes, such as against Omanyte, into 2HKOes, and it prevents Recover users like Staryu and Porygon from trying to PP stall it. Hypnosis is Drowzee's wild card—it dissuades every unstatused foe from switching in and can let Drowzee win otherwise unwinnable matchups against Pokemon like Fearow and Pinsir, but its terrible accuracy makes it extremely unreliable; one or two misses lead to Drowzee being KOed without doing anything. Generally, Drowzee should stick to using Thunder Wave and Psychic to make progress and only use Hypnosis when it forces something out or when its other moves simply won't be enough, such as against Rest Arcanine or Agility Fearow when no switch-ins are available. Seismic Toss targets opposing Psychic-types, notably 4HKOing opposing Drowzee and 3HKOing and 4HKOing the rare Abra and Slowpoke, respectively.
Drowzee is best used to support offensive Pokemon like Nidoqueen, Seaking, Machamp, and Sandslash by crippling their checks. Its ability to dominate Porygon is crucial, as very few Pokemon check it while not being easily checked by something else. Drowzee struggles the most against offensive threats that have ways around paralysis, like Fearow with Agility and Arcanine with Rest. Switch-ins to them, like Graveler for the former and Omanyte for the latter, are good partners; Omanyte has the added benefit of countering Rapidash, which despises paralysis but generally beats Drowzee one-on-one. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are themselves good partners, as alongside their ability to trade with each other they can also handle Pinsir, which easily breaks through Drowzee due to its powerful Slash. Despite its weakness to Psychic, Nidoqueen can switch into Thunder Wave and beat Drowzee one-on-one, so checks to it like Porygon and Machamp work well. Fellow paralysis spreaders like the aforementioned Porygon and Staryu also make good partners, as together they maximize the paralysis spread to enable their offensive teammates. Drowzee is a solid check to opposing Psychic-types, as it's reliably able to trade with itself and beat the rare Abra and Slowpoke. In a pinch it can check Gastly, though it must be wary of Explosion, which does around 70%.

Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Agility + Partial Trapping, Hypno, and Articuno. Dugtrio is generally considered good in the current metagame. The most up to date moveset for Dugtrio is the following.
Comments: Other Options
Generally, Dugtrio doesn't need any moves outside of its main set. Body Slam can be nice to paralyze checks such as the relatively uncommon Aerodactyl, but the only Pokemon you will commonly see that Dugtrio doesn't naturally outspeed is opposing Dugtrio. Even worse, Body Slam is only useful against opposing Dugtrio on the switch, as either Dugtrio can 2HKO the other with Earthquake one-on-one. Another severe downside of using Body Slam is its damage output in comparison to Slash: whereas Slash can do 30% to Gyarados, Body Slam does half that. Where Slash lets Dugtrio 4HKO Tangela and potentially catch it at half health while it switches in, Body Slam can't even reliably 6HKO Tangela. Sand Attack could be used to pray for misses in desperate scenarios, like when Dodrio is about to set up and run over your team or Dugtrio is your last Pokemon left and needs to land multiple critical hits. It can also stop Dragonite from setting up Agility and sweeping through your team with Wrap, but it's less reliable than Toxic and has its effect nullified by switching. It can technically be used to severely reduce Tentacruel's Wrap accuracy, though the only time Dugtrio should be facing Tentacruel is if it is in Earthquake KO range anyway.
Checks and Counters
Paralysis: Dugtrio relies heavily on its Speed to stop foes from capitalizing on its weak defenses, which makes paralysis so deadly for it. Dugtrio is immune to Thunder Wave, but Stun Spore—used commonly by Tangela and the rare Venomoth—and Body Slam—from attackers like Kangaskhan, Gyarados, and opposing Dugtrio—can cripple Dugtrio for the rest of the game.
Strong Attacks: In general, Dugtrio is unable to take more than one attack without fainting, so any strong attack—such as Kangaskhan's Body Slam and Hypno or Kadabra's Psychic—hitting it should enable any other Pokemon to pick it off. Even worse, many common special attacks, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Surf from Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, are super effective and will OHKO Dugtrio.
Flying-types: Flying-types are most teams' main defensive answers to Dugtrio, as they can switch into its Earthquake and threaten it out with heavy damage, if not an outright OHKO. Dragonite is best at dealing with Dugtrio, as the threat Dragonite poses with Agility and Wrap is so significant that Dugtrio often has to stay in and use Toxic, which can come at the cost of Dugtrio taking a Blizzard and being put at 20% health or lower. Gyarados is similar in its ability to answer Dugtrio, and while it lacks the threat of Agility + Wrap to keep Dugtrio from switching out, it is much harder for Dugtrio's teammates to force out due to its superior defensive typing. Aerodactyl can switch in on Dugtrio's Earthquake with impunity and 2HKO it, but it struggles to switch in on Rock Slide. Dodrio and Articuno are the last two common Flying-types that teams use to check Dugtrio. While they are significantly frailer than Dragonite and Gyarados, respectively 3HKOed and 2HKOed by Rock Slide, they can both OHKO Dugtrio with their STAB attacks and threaten to run through its team after an Agility boost.
Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types like Vaporeon, Poliwrath, and the rare Dewgong can take Earthquake multiple times while KOing Dugtrio with their STAB Surf and using Rest to remain healthy and answer Dugtrio over the course of a match. However, Dugtrio's critical hit rate can allow it to bypass these answers if they are below 75% health, and Dewgong can't repeatedly switch into Rock Slide without being forced to use Rest.
Tangela and Venusaur: Tangela is one of the best Dugtrio answers in RBY UU, taking almost no damage from Earthquake and threatening Dugtrio in return with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore. Tangela can also heal off any chip damage it sustains on the way in with Mega Drain, and it can potentially use Dugtrio as an opportunity to begin accumulating boosts with Growth. Venusaur is similar in this regard, coming in on Earthquake and threatening to put Dugtrio or a teammate to sleep with Sleep Powder or OHKO Dugtrio with Razor Leaf. However, Venusaur is worse at checking Dugtrio than Tangela due to its worse bulk and Ground neutrality.
Kangaskhan: If Kangaskhan is healthy, it can switch into Dugtrio's Earthquake and threaten to cripple or KO Dugtrio with its STAB Body Slam or Hyper Beam.
Persian and Hypno: While they can't switch in, Hypno and Persian can win the one-on-one matchup with Dugtrio from full health if it doesn't land a critical hit.

Outdated Analysis
Overview
Dugtrio succeeds as RBY UU’s most influential revenge killer and sweeper. Dugtrio's fantastic speed tier, perfect coverage, and Thunder Wave immunity give it the perfect combination of traits to fulfill these roles extremely effectively. Regardless of its health, Dugtrio can very easily close games with its powerful STAB Earthquake, especially considering it boasts an enormous 23.44% critical hit rate. As such, keeping Pokemon out of range of Dugtrio is a key aspect of mastering RBY UU; even tier king Tentacruel must be cautious, as it can drop to an Earthquake as early as 79.3%. This offensive prowess forces the majority of competitive teams to include several checks to it.
While Dugtrio is incredibly strong, it is not without its flaws. While its typing provides it with good utility, it also opens it up to numerous weaknesses to common attacks such as Surf, Blizzard, and Razor Leaf. This, combined with its extreme frailty, causes it to crumble when confronted with any sort of offensive pressure. In addition to this, several Pokemon are either immune or resistant to its Earthquake, most notably Dragonite, Gyarados, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. This culminates into Dugtrio having a much more polarized matchup spread than other notable revenge killers, such as Persian or Kadabra. Regardless, Dugtrio remains one of the common and potent threats in the tier for which every team must prepare.

STAB Earthquake is excellent given Tentacruel's prominence, both 2HKOing it and supporting your own Tentacruel by 2HKOing all of its counters save Persian. Many of these targets can be put in KO range with a small amount of chip damage or a critical hit. Dugtrio also outspeeds all threats to Tentacruel besides opposing Dugtrio, which lets it worry less about its frailty. Earthquake's high power combined with Dugtrio's high critical hit chance makes Dugtrio an effective wallbreaker and general attacker. Through Rock Slide, Dugtrio can hit all Flying-types for super effective damage, further limiting how often the opponent can let Dugtrio come on the field before they start losing Pokemon. The next move is commonly Slash, which stops Tangela from completely walling Dugtrio and can act as a safe midground option to avoid reading whether opponents will switch to a Flying-type or not. Substitute is another option for Dugtrio's third move to make it an even more effective late-game sweeper. Dugtrio can set up a Substitute while the opponent switches to sacrifice a team member at low health, and it can then close out the game against a weakened team that can't break the Substitute and force Dugtrio out. The last moveslot is dedicated to Toxic, as it prevents Dragonite from freely coming in on Earthquake and setting up Agility safely.
Dugtrio acts as a late-game sweeper and a potent offensive threat. Using Dugtrio optimally is a delicate balancing act of making the most of its limited opportunities to come onto the field while also keeping it as healthy as possible, a balance that often separates novice players from veterans. Partial-trapping moves—most commonly Wrap—are one of the primary ways Dugtrio can be brought onto the field safely, since they both provide the chip damage needed to bring targets into OHKO range and allow Dugtrio to switch in while the opposing Pokemon is unable to attack. Therefore, Wrap users such as Dragonite and especially Tentacruel make for excellent Dugtrio partners. Tentacruel is the best Dugtrio partner in the game; not only does it provide Wrap support and benefit from Dugtrio KOing primary answers to it after minor chip damage, such as opposing Tentacruel, Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Raichu, but it takes very little damage from Blizzard and Surf aimed at Dugtrio. The opponent's Tentacruel using Wrap is another common way Dugtrio can get onto the battlefield safely, as Dugtrio takes relatively little chip damage from Wrap while outspeeding and KOing the opposing Tentacruel if it is sufficiently weakened. A teammate using Explosion or fainting is another common entrance point for Dugtrio, as its high Speed and damage output allow it to act as an effective revenge killer. Other good opportunities for Dugtrio to enter the battlefield include sleeping Pokemon, a predicted switch, a recovery move that doesn't let the foe escape Dugtrio's KO range, and Electric-type moves such as Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt. Frequently, Dugtrio will be able to clean up teams that have been weakened to the point where it can OHKO every remaining Pokemon; this is a relatively common win condition in RBY UU that should always be kept in mind over the course of the game. Learning to capitalize on opportunities to set up this endgame while simultaneously hindering an opponent carrying Dugtrio from doing the same is an important skill for UU players to learn.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Electabuzz is generally considered good in the current metagame.
<hr>
Electabuzz is the premier Electric-type in RBY UU thanks to its base 105 Speed, which lets it outspeed tier-king Tentacruel and force it out with Thunder Wave. Its Speed also grants it an impressive 20.51% critical hit rate, making it difficult to consistently wall. Additionally, Electabuzz is blessed with good coverage in Psychic and Body Slam, which gives it a variety of ways to check threats like Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur. Naturally, this also makes Electabuzz effective late-game, making Pokemon like Articuno and Dodrio think twice before going for a sweep. With its strong hit-and-run playstyle, proactive gameplay is key to being successful with Electabuzz.
However, Electabuzz can be inconsistent, which makes it a bit difficult to use on teams. It struggles while paralyzed, so it cannot typically stay in against common Thunder Wave users such as Kadabra and Hypno and struggles against Body Slam users like Gyarados, Vaporeon, and Omastar that it otherwise matches well against. Its Special is unimpressive against neutral- or high-Special targets, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Tentacruel and Vaporeon and dealing less damage than Seismic Toss on average against Hypno. Furthermore, Electabuzz lacks reliable recovery—unlike Kadabra, which operates similarly—while being 2HKOed and 3HKOed by most physical and special attackers, respectively, making it very easy to wear down. The massive presence of Dugtrio is very problematic for Electabuzz as well, with it constantly switching in on Thunderbolt and threatening a KO from Earthquake with minimal prior damage. Electabuzz also competes with Raichu, which has Surf, Agility, and higher Attack and Special; however, outrunning Tentacruel and having Psychic usually makes Electabuzz the better choice, especially as a lead.
Comments: Other Options
While Electabuzz has an incredible movepool, fine-tuning it is often a misguided attempt that makes it easier to counter than it should be. Changing its listed coverage can be very difficult to justify, as it covers every Pokemon in the tier. Mega Kick can replace Seismic Toss, as it 2HKOes Kadabra while doing more damage to Hypno and opposing Electabuzz. However, it does less damage to Tangela and has only 74.6% accuracy. Hyper Beam performs similarly and has higher accuracy, which may make it more enticing, but Raichu often runs it more effectively thanks to its superior Attack stat. Substitute can scout an attack or an opponent's switch-in without needing to predict, and Electabuzz can use it to fish for full paralysis and a free chance to attack. However, Electabuzz can only take advantage of Substitute late-game when Pokemon that spread status like Hypno and Kadabra are either KOed or able to be KOed with one attack. Submission may seem enticing to damage Normal-types and Golem, but Thunderbolt or Psychic, respectively, damages them more consistently as a result of better accuracy, making it difficult to recommend. Counter can sneak an OHKO on Persian using Slash, but in this situation, Electabuzz should be going for Thunder Wave paralysis.
Checks and Counters
Ground-types: Ground-types are immune to Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt while dealing massive damage back with STAB Earthquake. Dugtrio outspeeds Electabuzz and can OHKO with a critical hit Earthquake, and without a critical hit if Electabuzz has taken even slight damage. Alternatively, Dugtrio can predict Electabuzz switching out to set up a Substitute. However, Dugtrio fears Body Slam's paralysis and doesn't like taking chip damage, so it struggles to switch in. Meanwhile, Golem is only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and Psychic, so it can come in fairly safely and force Electabuzz out. Golem then has the opportunity to set up a Substitute, use Explosion, scout with Body Slam, or just get off decent damage with a STAB move. However, it can't repeatedly switch in should Electabuzz predict correctly, which can force it to use Explosion noticeably earlier, and Special drops can make Psychic a 3HKO.
Grass-types: Electabuzz struggles to damage Grass-types and hates getting statused, making Tangela and Venusaur great checks. Tangela carries Stun Spore in addition to Sleep Powder and isn't weak to any of Electabuzz's attacks, making it generally a better check. However, Venusaur does have more offensive power—Razor Leaf is a clean 3HKO—and may do more for a team overall.
Hypno: Hypno is the best Electabuzz check that does not resist Thunderbolt. It can paralyze Electabuzz or put it to sleep while not worrying about Electabuzz's own Thunder Wave. Hypno sometimes even prefers being paralyzed so that it cannot be put to sleep later on. Hypno also has good bulk, only being 4HKOed by Seismic Toss and sometimes Thunderbolt. Meanwhile, it can 3HKO Electabuzz with Psychic, and any drop to Electabuzz's underwhelming Special is a very bad situation for it. However, if Hypno is caught using Rest, Electabuzz can be very dangerous, as a single critical hit can force Hypno to use Rest again; this opens it up for wallbreakers like Kangaskhan to switch in and finish the job.
Paralysis: Electabuzz relies on its Speed, so paralyzing it greatly cripples its effectiveness, exposing its decidedly mediocre bulk. Therefore, the mere possibility of getting paralyzed often forces it out, giving momentum to Thunder Wave and Body Slam users like Clefable, Kadabra, Hypno, Kangaskhan, and even some Dragonite variants. However, many Body Slam users, such as Vaporeon and Omastar, greatly fear Electabuzz's STAB Thunderbolt. In a pinch, though, they can fight back and hope for a Body Slam paralysis, especially in Vaporeon's case, since Thunderbolt only 3HKOes it. Non-Seismic Toss variants of Electabuzz will struggle to punish a Tangela switch-in, allowing it to get off Stun Spore with impunity.
Electric-types: While Electabuzz has fantastic coverage, it tends to struggle with opposing Electric-types. Opposing Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode may trade Thunder Wave with it while resisting Thunderbolt. Raichu also notably outdamages Electabuzz, possessing a higher Special stat, Surf, and Hyper Beam. Electrode doesn't entirely mind paralysis, as possessing Explosion means it always has some kind of value; however, it may become forced to use Explosion against Electabuzz in some scenarios, which may not be a favorable trade, as there are vastly better targets like Hypno and Tentacruel. Overall, if Electabuzz needs to be slowed down, going for a paralysis trade with your own Electric-type is absolutely fine.
Moveset: Offensive (old)
Description: Set Description
A fast Thunder Wave is Electabuzz's claim to fame and forms its main role in tandem with Thunderbolt: paralyzing fast Pokemon and breaking through bulky Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados and Dodrio. This paves the way for sweepers like Dugtrio and Articuno while also making wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite more devastating, providing massive momentum in the long run and often choking the opponent out of options late-game. Electabuzz's Thunderbolt is quite threatening, being one of few moves to have a reasonable chance to OHKO Gyarados, 76.9%; it also 2HKOes Dodrio, Dewgong, and Omastar. Being faster than Tentacruel and having Thunder Wave also makes Electabuzz incredible at forcing the opponent into predictable switches, particularly to Dugtrio, Hypno, and Tangela; those switches are ripe for exploitation, making a well-played Electabuzz a massive late-game threat, especially when factoring in being faster than Tentacruel.
Body Slam gives Electabuzz an effective midground option, notably letting it paralyze Dugtrio switching in. It also does decent damage to physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra, especially with Electabuzz's good critical hit rate. When one is unsure about using Thunder Wave, Body Slam is normally the best option. Psychic provides another midground option that covers Haunter and Tentacruel more effectively; getting a Special drop can make Thunderbolt significantly more threatening as well, giving a near-guaranteed KO on Tentacruel after Psychic damage. It's also helpful for hitting Venusaur and Haunter super effectively, which are common problems for most Electric-types. Another less appreciated boon is that if you use Electabuzz to trade paralysis, Psychic Special drops reapply the foe's paralysis Speed drop; this allows Electabuzz to muscle past with Thunderbolt thereafter. Seismic Toss can be used over either Body Slam or Psychic to deal more damage to Golem, Hypno, and Tangela on average.
Electabuzz should ideally play hit-and-run because of its distaste for paralysis, but it can also trade paralysis if the team doesn't rely on its offensive prowess and speed control. However, a late-game sweep should never be counted out, as Electabuzz is excellent in simplified game states, gradually picking off limping Pokemon. It is ideal to bring Electabuzz in through a teammate's Wrap or on an opposing Pokemon using Rest, as it's frail and generally wants to stay healthy for late-game. Predicting an opponent's switch to Tentacruel or Gyarados can also be effective; Articuno and Dugtrio are good Pokemon to use for baiting these in. Electabuzz should generally use Thunder Wave whenever you are confident that a fast Pokemon, like Tentacruel or Persian, will stay in to attack. Finding these opportunities is important because Hypno often switches into Electabuzz, stealing momentum and using paralysis sustained from Thunder Wave to block further status.
Electabuzz can be used as a lead; this is primarily for the common Tentacruel matchup. Because it outspeeds and paralyzes Tentacruel, Tentacruel is forced out immediately, giving Electabuzz an uncontested Thunder Wave, switch, or damage opportunity. In this situation, Body Slam is the most appropriate as a midground option, covering their switch while dealing decent damage with a chance of paralysis. Thunder Wave is also useful to status sleep leads like Haunter and Venusaur, as well as rarer leads like Dodrio. Lead Electabuzz tends to be less valuable, so sacrificing it to sleep is often the appropriate option, sparing more valuable common teammates like Tentacruel, Hypno, and Kadabra. On teams where Electabuzz is okay with being paralyzed, it can trade paralysis with Kadabra and attempt to break through it with Seismic Toss as well, though Electabuzz is at a disadvantage due to a lack of recovery, so switching to a paralysis absorber like Hypno or Vaporeon is recommended instead. Against Hypno, sacking Electabuzz for sleep or trading Thunder Wave is valid because, in the prior case, it can be woken up through Tentacruel's Wrap with relative ease later on, and for the latter case, it is capable of muscling past paralyzed Hypno through critical hits. However, while it may seem enticing to use Thunder Wave against Hypno right away, this often invites Dugtrio in, so using Body Slam is usually more reliable.
Electabuzz is best used on teams that are already efficient at checking Dugtrio while having a strong offensive backbone. The best way to facilitate this situation is with Flying-types like Aerodactyl, Articuno, Dragonite, and Gyarados—and, to a lesser extent, Tangela—which check Dugtrio by forcing it to think twice before it uses Earthquake. These Pokemon also invite Tentacruel in, which Electabuzz feasts on. Articuno is particularly valuable, as Electabuzz breaking through Water- and Grass-types is instrumental in allowing it to sweep late-game, making the pair a strong offensive core. Wallbreakers such as Dodrio, Kangaskhan, and Persian take advantage of Hypno using Rest, a key part of gaining momentum in RBY UU, and Electabuzz spreads paralysis for them. Dodrio also has a great matchup against Grass-types like Venusaur and Tangela, as well as an immunity to Earthquake to set up on Dugtrio, making it among the best Normal-type Electabuzz partners. Kangaskhan is also helpful against Dugtrio thanks to its high physical bulk and appreciates Electabuzz paralyzing its checks for it to wallbreak later on. While used on almost every team, Tentacruel can bait opposing Tentacruel in very frequently, and its Wrap support is instrumental in allowing Electabuzz to enter the game safely, making it an especially perfect partner. While similar to Electabuzz, Kadabra is also a great partner, forming a strong special attacking core that can overwhelm common Hypno + Kadabra cores; trading Electabuzz with one of them lets Kadabra and Hypno teammates wreak havoc. Finally, Venusaur performs excellently alongside Electabuzz, being a fine Pokemon to double switch into when predicting the opponent will go to Hypno or Dugtrio, getting a free sleep move off as to enable Electabuzz to switch in later; this can be done as early as turn 1 one with lead Electabuzz.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Electrode is generally considered good in the current metagame.
<hr>
Electrode holds a highly specific niche in the RBY UU metagame. As the game's fastest Pokemon, Electrode is nearly guaranteed to attack before fainting if it enters the battle safely, even if it doesn't have the most diverse attacks. This Speed most notably allows Electrode to pressure quick tier mainstays like Tentacruel and Dugtrio. Its high Speed also blesses it with a 27.3% critical hit chance, which can elevate its weak attacks to extreme heights; for example, a critical hit Explosion will always OHKO Hypno. Its Speed and Thunder Wave make it an above average switch into Wrap users as well. These attributes also enable Electrode to be used as a lead or even a sweeper in some cases.
Unfortunately, Electrode’s flaws are abundant and quite detrimental. Outside of Explosion, Electrode has very few distinctive moves for an Electric-type Pokemon. Without Body Slam or Double-Edge, let alone any diverse coverage move, Electrode is forced to use moves like Take Down just to damage Ground-type Pokemon. Electrode's offenses are also inferior to those of its main competitors, Electabuzz and Raichu. These flaws culminate into Electrode being relatively easy to wall and KO. As such, using Electrode often boils down to attacking once or twice and then trying to get lucky with Explosion. It is a high-risk Pokemon that requires accurate predictions and a little bit of luck to reap a proportionate reward.
Comments: Other Options
Thunder is an option open to every Electric-type Pokemon so they can hit a little harder at the cost of some accuracy. Two notable benchmarks for Electrode's Thunder include a possible 2HKO against Vaporeon and a guaranteed 2HKO against Tentacruel, which Thunderbolt misses and only has a 5.4% chance to do, respectively.
Electrode has a number of defensive options such as Light Screen and Rest. These can be used to improve a few particular matchups, such as against other Electric-types. Rest is notable for curing Electrode of paralysis, which is usually fatal for it. Overall, offensive options tend to be a lot more useful.
Substitute can be helpful on such a prediction-reliant Pokemon. For example, it can serve as a nice midground play in situations like the Dugtrio matchup. If Dugtrio switches, Electrode can attack more freely on the next turn, and if Dugtrio attacks, Electrode will suffer a smaller penalty. However, like the defensive options, it is difficult to find a spot for Substitute.
Flash can be somewhat useful at motivating the foe to switch and can hinder Wrap users. However, Screech and Thunder Wave tend to accomplish these goals better and have superior accuracy.
Checks and Counters
Ground-type Pokemon: Ground-type Pokemon are pretty tricky for Electrode because they pressure it to use a weak Normal-type move or Explosion. Golem is Electrode’s worst nightmare because it takes roughly 20% from Explosion. Golem can switch into Electrode freely and repeatedly, and then fire off a free STAB attack or set up a Substitute. Electrode can threaten Dugtrio with Explosion, but Dugtrio can survive the attack two-thirds of the time and is relatively unafraid of a paralyzed Electrode.
Paralysis: Paralysis is a death sentence for Electrode. Electrode is incredibly reliant on its Speed, so taking that away exposes its middling defenses. Paralyzed Electrode can be easily KOed by wallbreakers and sweepers like Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Persian, Articuno, and so on. Additionally, the 25% chance of full paralysis may also keep a weakened Electrode from using Explosion before it is KOed.
Grass- and Electric-type Pokemon: While not quite as bad as Ground-type Pokemon, Grass-type Pokemon also wall Electrode. Thunderbolt deals very little damage to Pokemon like Tangela and Venusaur, so they can goad it into using Explosion. Additionally, status moves like Sleep Powder and Stun Spore will hamper Electrode’s usefulness. Electric-type Pokemon similarly resist Thunderbolt and can paralyze Electrode. While neither really wants to take Thunder Wave, Electabuzz and Raichu have better coverage moves than Electrode, so they will generally win one-on-one or force Explosion.
Pokemon that Resist Explosion: Aside from Golem, most common Rock- and Ghost-type Pokemon do not want to switch into Electrode. However, having them on a team can still make Electrode hesitate to use Explosion, into which they switch fairly comfortably.
Moveset: Fast Attacker
Description: Set Description
Thunderbolt is pretty much Electrode's only reliable source of damage. Electrode isn't the strongest user of Thunderbolt, but it can still hit common Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dodrio, and bulky Water-type Pokemon for good damage, especially if it scores a critical hit. Assuming the opponent lacks a Ground-type Pokemon, Electrode can reliably paralyze any foe thanks to its high Speed. This is particularly useful for slowing down Agility sweepers like Articuno and Dragonite. Electrode's reliance on Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave encourages Ground-type Pokemon to switch in, so it is wise to run Pokemon that can capitalize on this, such as Gyarados, Poliwrath, and Tangela. Hypno is also likely to switch in against Electrode, making fast sleep users such as Venusaur good partners as well.
Explosion is Electrode’s main selling point. While Electrode’s base Attack stat of 50 is underwhelming, Explosion is still quite strong, especially if it happens to be a critical hit. Explosion has many desirable targets, such as Dugtrio, Hypno, Tentacruel, and Kadabra, the last of which will always be KOed. However, there are also many Pokemon that Electrode doesn’t want to hit, such as Rock-type Pokemon, sleeping and frozen Pokemon, and, worst of all, Haunter. Electrode is thus a very prediction-heavy Pokemon. As an example, suppose Electrode is face-to-face with Dugtrio. Explosion can OHKO Dugtrio, especially if Dugtrio took a little chip damage. Dugtrio will deal a minimum of 73% to Electrode with Earthquake. This creates a 50/50 situation of whether Dugtrio will switch out in fear of Explosion or stay in and hope Electrode overpredicts by using something else. Electrode creates situations like this a lot, especially if it is played in the mid- or late-game. Using Electrode effectively often means making some bold (or lucky) predictions or spending a lot of effort so these predictions aren’t necessary. This volatility can help Electrode take down some important targets with little issue but also risks it fainting for naught. If Electrode does hit its desired target, it establishes a better position for its teammates. For example, blowing up on Tentacruel or Hypno might help Articuno sweep, while hitting Dugtrio should keep Pokemon like Kadabra and Raichu safe.
Screech helps Electrode get the most out of its Explosion. While the move may suffer from an unimpressive accuracy of 84.4%, over half the Pokemon prominent in the RBY UU metagame may or will faint to Electrode's Explosion after Screech. Not only will key offensive Pokemon like Tentacruel, Dugtrio, and Persian be guaranteed to faint, but bulkier Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Gyarados have a chance as well. This threat incentivizes foes to switch without actually forcing Electrode to blow up, allowing it to potentially use Thunderbolt or Thunder Wave uncontested or bring in a teammate more safely. Screech is also remarkably useful in situations where the foe is unwilling or unable to switch, like after it has used a stat-boosting move or when it is the last Pokemon remaining. In these cases, Electrode can be more confident that it will be able to deal large amounts of damage to its desired target.
Despite Screech's benefits, it is still viable to run an arbitrary Normal-type attack just so Electrode can hit Ground-type foes without KOing itself. Take Down can be fairly strong with a critical hit, but it is otherwise a painfully mediocre move with low accuracy as well as recoil, and Hyper Beam, while powerful, can leave Electrode susceptible to being paralyzed or KOed if it fails to KO the foe first.
Finally, it is worth noting that Electrode can serve as a lead. This is partially because Electrode has much trouble switching into most Pokemon. While not as consistent as more traditional choices, Electrode can break a few holes earlier in the match and help its teammates arrange a sweep by mixing up options like fast Thunder Wave, STAB Thunderbolt, and powerful Explosion. Conversely, Electrode's high Speed makes it a decent late-game sweeper as well. However, its poor coverage tends to make Pokemon like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Agility users superior options for the role.

Overview: What Exeggcute lacks in stats, it makes up for in status moves and typing, utilizing its key Psychic and Electric resistances to spread sleep and paralysis. It is one of the few Pokemon available that can inflict sleep consistently. It can switch into, status, and wear down the opponent's Mr. Mime without exposing your own Mr. Mime to paralysis, keeping it healthy so it can run rampant later in the match. Its resistance to Mr. Mime's, Electrode's, and Venomoth's primary attacks makes it good support for teams otherwise vulnerable to these foes, and it minds paralysis less than most Pokemon. It also packs Explosion to heavily damage a foe on the way out and grant free entry to a deadly attacker or setup sweeper, allowing for clever positioning to set up a nice endgame sweep.
Exeggcute's typing does, however, make it extremely vulnerable to the plentiful Fire- and Ice-type attacks in the tier. Even though it resists Earthquake, its very low Speed and lack of Grass-type STAB moves make it a mediocre Golem check, and its low Special and Ice weakness make it an extremely unreliable switch-in to Nidoking. Its physical bulk, while passable, is insufficient to avoid OHKOs from Kingler's and Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beams, leaving it unable to stop their sweeps with Stun Spore. Additionally, its low offensive stats leave it rather passive after it spreads status, and it will almost certainly get paralyzed as it tries to put something to sleep, which leaves it with an inconsistent 56% chance to actually land its status moves thereafter. Nonetheless, Exeggcute is a considerable thorn in the side of almost any NU team given the sheer prevalence of Mr. Mime and Venomoth.
Comments: Other Options
Rest gives Exeggcute longevity against Mr. Mime and Electrode, letting it continually frustrate their attempts to make progress and provide a safe switch for Pokemon vulnerable to them. However, due to its low bulk and common weaknesses, it invites sweepers like Nidoking and Raticate and Swords Dance users like Kingler and Kabutops in, letting them throw out devastating attacks while it is asleep. It also must fear repeated Special drops from Mr. Mime, which will eventually force a switch. Double-Edge could be used to pressure Mr. Mime slightly more heavily than Psychic; however, it only threatens a 5HKO with Exeggcute's dismal Attack stat, and the move weakens Exeggcute with recoil damage. Alternatively, Egg Bomb avoids recoil damage at the cost of a poor 74.7% accuracy. Solar Beam is Exeggcute's only Grass-type attack—it threatens Kingler, Kabutops, and Golem with an OHKO and inflicts massive damage on Blastoise and Seadra. However, since the opponent can simply switch out during its charge turn, Solar Beam is only possibly useful late-game, when they might lack healthy Grass-resistant Pokemon to tank it.
Checks and Counters
Bulky Water-types: Blastoise and Seadra are faster than Exeggcute, aren't threatened much by its Psychic or Explosion, aren't affected heavily by paralysis, and shred Exeggcute with Ice-type attacks. Blastoise's Seismic Toss followed by Blizzard has an 82% chance to KO, making it nearly impossible for Exeggcute to switch in or bait an attack to pivot in a teammate.
Fire-types: All fully-evolved Fire-types outspeed and OHKO Exeggcute with Fire Blast, and they are either 5HKOed or 4HKOed by Exeggcute's weak Psychic. Stun Spore on the switch takes their greatest asset away, though.
Clefable and Wigglytuff: Both Clefable and Wigglytuff outspeed and 2HKO Exeggcute with Blizzard, and if they don't have that, they can 3HKO with two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. They are already slower than most of the tier and thus aren't harmed much by paralysis, and Psychic only 5HKOes them, letting them bully Exeggcute once Sleep Powder isn't an option.
Fearow, Raticate, and Nidoking: In a pinch, these fast offensive Pokemon 2HKO Exeggcute to win one-on-one, but all are severely hampered by paralysis, and Nidoking especially does not take Psychic well. They are very effective at punishing Rest Exeggcute, taking advantage of its sleeping turns to switch in safely and blow holes in its team.
Moveset: Support
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Exeggcute's primary goal is to get in and put something to sleep as soon as it can, and then it attempts to spread paralysis to support its team. Teammates shouldn't paralyze Pokemon Exeggcute struggles to handle, like Fire-types, before Exeggcute gets in and puts a foe to sleep. Psychic is Exeggcute's best attacking option and hits most Pokemon in the tier for neutral damage. Psychic's 33.2% chance of reducing Special helps Exeggcute to overcome its passiveness, breaking down even bulky foes when combined with paralysis. A Special drop also provides defensive benefits, such as preventing Blastoise and Seadra from 2HKOing Exeggcute with Blizzard and reducing even Moltres's nuclear Fire Blast to a 2HKO, giving a healthy Exeggcute the option to boldly stay in on Fire-types and debilitate them with status. Explosion allows Exeggcute to take out over two-thirds of Mr. Mime's HP, leaving it in KO range for most allies, or to deal around 50% to most foes while granting an ally free entry. This allows Exeggcute to grab momentumwhen it's about to faint anyway and potentially set up an ally's sweep.
Water-types in particular have good synergy with Exeggcute, covering for its weakness to Fire and Ice, while Exeggcute in turn covers their Electric weaknesses. Kingler and Kabutops also benefit from Exeggcute's relatively weak Explosion, which can grant them a safe moment to set up Swords Dance against a weakened foe. Powerhouses below base 90 Speed, like Nidoking and Kingler, enjoy Exeggcute as a relatively safe switch-in to escape heavy damage or paralysis from Mr. Mime, Electrode, or Venomoth, and it can inflict status to help them blow apart the opposing team. While Exeggcute can't fight Ground- and Water-types one-on-one, its resistances to their STAB attacks let it bait out their weaker coverage moves, letting teammates switch in more safely.

Overview: Farfetch'd is like a far weaker Fearow and has no reasonable niche in PU. Its main upside over Fearow is access to STAB Slash, which does slightly more damage to neutral targets than Fearow's Double-Edge and lacks recoil; however, Fearow has Drill Peck, Hyper Beam, and significantly better stats to more than compensate. Farfetch'd OHKOes Abra without needing to risk Hyper Beam, unlike Fearow, but Pinsir's Slash is actually stronger and achieves the same; also, Pinsir is not walled by Rock-types and has much better stats. Farfetch'd also has Body Slam and Swords Dance, which other Flying-types lack, but it will rarely have the time to even set up Agility, let alone a second move. Farfetch'd's poor Speed and bulk make it difficult for it to contribute; attackers like Nidoqueen, Pinsir, Fearow, and all Fire-types outspeed and 2HKO it. Therefore, just about any team is better served by Fearow or Pinsir instead.
Comments: 
Moveset: Double Dance
Description: Slash is the only tangible benefit to Farfetch'd, OHKOing Abra and dealing decent damage to neutral targets. Agility allows it to outspeed foes and perhaps sweep a heavily weakened team, but Slash fails to 2HKO most fully-evolved foes, making this difficult. Swords Dance can potentially boost another move to be stronger than Slash, but unless the opponent is catatonic, they will likely not grant Farfetch'd multiple turns to set up. Body Slam can fish for paralysis, while Double-Edge is Farfetch'd's strongest attack at +2. As far as other options, Farfetch'd lacks the time to set up with Substitute and Sand Attack, and its movepool is otherwise barren.

Format: NU
Overview: Fearow boasts a myriad of highly coveted attributes that only it can proudly claim in NU. With a blistering base 100 base speed, Fearow speed ties with Charizard and Ninetales while outpacing tier staples like Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Nidoking. The relatively high critical hit chance provided by its Speed. coupled with STAB Hyper Beam makes Fearow a phenomenal cleaner against weakened teams, and can even further boost its Speed with Agility for insurance against faster foes and to bypass the Speed drop from paralysis. Fearow is a great late-game cleaner and revenge killer due to its great Speed and powerful STAB moves, but due to its terrible bulk, it generally cannot afford to trade blows with anything it cannot KO. Fearow's defensive typing is quite double-edged, pun intended, and while a Ground immunity is great, Fearow's weakness to the ever-present BoltBeam coverage becomes quite a liability. Fearow is also completely walled by Rock-types, meaning it requires heavy support to guarantee it can fulfill its duty as a sweeper, while other fast cleaners like Charizard and Raticate can create holes in the opposing team for themselves, making them much more self-sufficient.
Comments: 
Moveset: All-Out Attacker
Description: Drill Peck can be used to easily 2HKO Sleep Powder users Venomoth and Exeggcute without taking recoil damage and also bypasses Counter, although it is significantly weaker than Fearow's other STAB options against other targets. Agility allows Fearow to clean up against the few Pokemon faster than it, and also avoid the speed tie with Charizard and Ninetales while outspeeding Electrode or to negate a Paralysis Speed drop. Mirror Move has niche applications that one may find game-to-game, copying Earthquake from a weakened Golem or Nidoking to pick it off, for example.
Because of Fearow's ability to sweep so well, Pokemon that often force trades like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Nidoking are great partners, as even if they can't take something out themselves, they always end up leaving the opponent at low HP—perfect for Fearow to prey on. Pokemon that can force damage on Golem and Kabutops, which are hard checks to Fearow, also make for great teammates. Super Fang Raticate, that carry either Blizzard or Bubble Beam for Golem and Thunderbolt for Kabutops can very effectively weaken the respective check for Fearow, making it a perfect teammate. Swords Dance Earthquake Charizard can also take huge chunks of HP off these Rock-types. Having these additional faster Pokemon often means the opponent's speed control beyond paralysis can easily be overwhelmed. In matchups without opposing Rock-types, Fearow's unresisted STAB moves can be used to its heart's content, 2HKOing other metagame staples like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Venomoth and opening up holes in defensive Pokemon like Kingler and Blastoise, although it must be wary of Counter from the latter. Weakening these bulky Water-types and forcing the opponent to reveal their Rock-type early if they have one is incredibly valuable for teammates like Charizard.

Overview: Flareon in RBY OU faces heavy competition from the bulkier and faster Moltres as a Fire-type mixed attacker. Its notably higher Attack stat paired with Body Slam pressures Chansey and Starmie more heavily than Moltres can, but it is crippled more by paralysis and fares notably worse against physical attackers like Snorlax and Tauros. Flareon is reliant on good prediction and some luck to be effective, making it a risky option not recommended for most RBY OU teams.
Comments: 
Moveset: Mixed Attacker
Description: Fire Blast is Flareon's strongest attack, though its 30.1% burn chance is a double-edged sword, as physical attackers are crippled but Pokemon with instant recovery benefit from burn blocking other status. Body Slam pressures special walls and Starmie and also threatens to paralyze non-Normal-types, while Hyper Beam provides power to finish them off once they are weakened enough.
Fire Spin helps Flareon to safely switch out against or wear down slower opponents. Tail Whip or Leer is an alternative option to help Flareon break through its counters. Starmie and Chansey are KOed by Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam at -1 Defense, either forcing them out or KOing them if they stay in. Additionally, when a paralyzed or burned Pokemon suffers a stat drop, the stat reduction from the Pokemon's status is applied again, for example causing a faster paralyzed Pokemon like Starmie to become slower than paralyzed Flareon after having its Defense reduced.

Format: PU
Overview: Despite possessing the highest BST in PU, Flareon is beyond outclassed. While Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar have much lower attacking stats, their excellent Speed improves their matchups across the board. Flareon's bad base 65 Speed, meanwhile, leaves it outsped by most of the metagame, including key threats like Nidoqueen. Even if it can still win against foes like Abra and Pinsir, having to take an extra hit means it gets worn down quickly and revenge killed by faster threats. Flareon often fails to outdamage faster Fire-types, as their higher Speed lets them launch more attacks against the opposing team. They also have traits that offer more game-to-game utility than Flareon's sheer damage. Rapidash outspeeds Fearow, Arcanine has excellent bulk, and Magmar has a diverse movepool, which notably can let it threaten Omanyte, something no other Fire-type can do.
Thus, you can only justify using Flareon alongside another Fire-type and heavy paralysis support. With proper support Flareon is a usable wallbreaker, as besides Omanyte, no Pokemon can safely switch into all of its attacks. Notably, it's among the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon. However, most of the time another duo of Fire-types will make more progress with less support, and thus Flareon should rarely see play.
Comments: Other Options
Toxic can be used alongside Fire Spin to let Flareon wear down Omanyte, but this means Flareon must give up Hyper Beam. Reflect can be used over Fire Spin to improve Flareon's matchups against many physical attackers, but its low Speed hampers this. Nidoqueen still 2HKOes Flareon unless it can use Reflect before Nidoqueen can land the first Earthquake, while Fearow's high critical hit rate and Pinsir's Slash can bypass Reflect's Defense boost. While weak, Quick Attack can be used to pick off physically frail foes, like Staryu and Abra.
Checks and Counters
Water-types: Omanyte's unique typing lets it take minimal damage from all of Flareon's attacks barring the rare Toxic plus Fire Spin combo, making it Flareon's hardest counter. Seaking outspeeds Flareon and 2HKOes it with Surf and is 3HKOed by Body Slam in return, though Seaking must be wary of Body Slam paralysis.
Arcanine: Arcanine's higher Speed and physical bulk let it outdamage Flareon one-on-one, especially if it's carrying Reflect.
Ground-types: Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Earthquake, while Flareon's Fire Blast only 2HKOes 3% of the time. Flareon outspeeds Graveler and 3HKOes it with Fire Blast, but it has a 17.9% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake. The rarer Sandslash speed ties Flareon and has a 33.3% chance to OHKO Flareon with Earthquake.
Fearow: Fearow outspeeds and 2HKOes Flareon with Double-Edge + Hyper Beam while only being 2HKOed by Fire Blast in return. While Fearow fears a burn, it is notably immune to Body Slam paralysis cannot be KOed by the combination of Body Slam and Fire Blast.
Faster Threats: While they usually lose to Flareon one-on-one, faster threats like Staryu and Pinsir can easily revenge kill Flareon due to their higher Speed.
Moveset: Mixed Attacker
Description: Set Description
Fire Blast can 2HKO most neutral targets and threatens to burn physical attackers. Body Slam lets Flareon fish for paralysis and hits most Fire-resistant switch-ins hard, including Arcanine, Staryu, and Dragonair. Hyper Beam is actually weaker than Fire Blast against most neutral foes, but it OHKOes Abra and serves as a powerful finisher against physically-frail Pokemon, like Drowzee, and Fire-resistant foes, barring Omanyte. Fire Spin lets Flareon wear down and pivot against slower Pokemon, though its terrible accuracy means it should be used sparingly.
Given that the other Fire-types often do Flareon's job better, it's best used alongside Rapidash or Arcanine as a slower but more powerful wallbreaker. Omanyte is the one wall Flareon has no hope of breaking through, so checks to it like Porygon and Gastly are essential partners. Paralysis support is also crucial for letting Flareon overwhelm its foes, so Thunder Wave users like Staryu, Drowzee, and the aforementioned Porygon are important.

Format: Stadium OU
Overview: Flareon experiences a stark shift from its original role in cartridge RBY, now functioning as a Focus Energy user in Stadium OU. Once boosted, Flareon becomes extremely threatening, with even Fire-resistant Pokemon like Slowbro and Starmie taking over 40% if Fire Blast lands a critical hit thereafter. It's not just a strong special attacker either; Flareon has a solid base 130 Attack stat to support it against Pokemon like Chansey, which it can 2HKO with consecutive critical hit Body Slams. If an opposing team has been paralyzed, Flareon can savagely rip into it with some of the strongest mixed offense available.
However, that's about all Flareon can offer: its firepower is no joke, but it's terrible on the defensive, taking serious damage from any attack, having zero defensive utility in its typing, and lacking reliable recovery. Its Speed also leaves a bit to be desired, with it being narrowly outrun by Cloyster, often meaning it requires paralysis support to be effective; this also makes it terrified of receiving paralysis itself. Because it demands paralysis support and offers little defensive utility, Flareon is difficult to build around. Additionally, it has no consistent methods of handling Water-types like Starmie and Slowbro, forcing it out and giving these two powerhouses significant momentum. Furthermore, Flareon is extremely inconsistent, relying on consecutive critical hits to KO Pokemon, which tend to only happen around a third of the time at best even after Focus Energy. Ergo, Flareon is a rare sight in the metagame.
Comments: 
Moveset: Focus Energy Wallbreaker
Description: Boasting a 58% critical hit rate when Focus Energy is used, Flareon can deal massive damage to anything it hits with critical hit Fire Blast, even possessing chances to OHKO Cloyster, Exeggutor, and Tauros. In fact, even Rhydon can take up to 60% while being outsped, though that KO is extremely risky to go for. The burn chance is also very helpful, crippling Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros while also aiding in KO ranges; however, landing a burn against Pokemon like Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey can make it significantly harder to beat them in the long run. Body Slam complements Fire Blast well, making Flareon more self-sufficient with paralysis while 2HKOing Chansey and Starmie with consecutive critical hits; however, it's recommended to use Substitute first in this scenario to avoid paralysis. A single critical hit can also put Alakazam into sub-25% range, meaning it cannot use Substitute thereafter; this also puts it in range for Quick Attack to KO. Quick Attack can be used to pick off Pokemon that barely survive Flareon's attacks, or that alternatively have used Substitute to the point they're left with 1 HP. However, Flareon can use Substitute itself for additional safety against paralysis users like Chansey and Exeggutor. It's worth attempting to set up Substitute against paralyzed Pokemon to try and get it for free with full paralysis. However, this is inconsistent, as setting up both Substitute and Focus Energy naturally means giving the opponent free turns, meaning the turns spent can be for naught.
Flareon has minor potential to be customized further; generally, the fourth moveslot is used. Double-Edge is a valid option, providing a good option to finish off limping Pokemon or pressure Substitute users while avoiding recoil. Additionally, a critical hit Double-Edge can KO Alakazam if it's taken minor damage or used Substitute. Flamethrower is also a fair option as an accurate Fire Blast alternative with far more PP, but the drop in damage is significant. While Hyper Beam's downsides are poor, a critical hit can OHKO Chansey, Jolteon, and Alakazam while KOing Starmie if it's taken even minute damage, though the recharge turn usually leads to Flareon taking paralysis right after.
Flareon is best used late-game when the opposing team has likely been paralyzed, though it can also be used to punish a Snorlax or Exeggutor asleep from Rest, which are decently common sights in the Stadium OU metagame. From there, Flareon can set up Focus Energy with impunity and start firing off potentially nuclear blows at the opposing team. While its consistency is poor, the reward often means removing crucial parts of the opposing team, which Flareon's teammates should greatly appreciate. Flareon works best alongside Pokemon that can consistently land paralysis on the opposing team, such as Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey. Because it struggles to break past Slowbro, Starmie, and the rare Kabutops, it's recommended to use it alongside consistent checks to them, such as Thunderbolt Chansey alongside Exeggutor.

Format: PU
Overview: Gastly is one of the most defining Pokemon in the PU metagame, being the fastest viable sleeper in the tier. Gastly is threatening even aside from sleep thanks to its high Special and combination of Psychic and Thunderbolt, which has perfect coverage and hits top threats such as Fearow and Nidoqueen super effectively. Gastly also has Explosion to deny setup sweepers and put many foes into KO range from Gastly's teammates. These traits make Gastly a powerhouse in the back, as it can put most foes to sleep and then threaten switch-ins with powerful attacks. Gastly can also switch into Normal-type moves such as Scyther's Slash and Arcanine's Hyper Beam without taking damage, something no other Pokemon in the tier can do. Gastly is also one of PU's best Seaking switch-ins, as it is only 3HKOed by Surf and can generate momentum for its team with the threat of Hypnosis and Thunderbolt, which lets it switch in once per game with minimal concern. However, Gastly is not flawless. Despite its unique defensive capabilities, it still suffers from bad physical bulk and a weak Poison typing. Its terrible physical bulk allows most neutral physical attacks such as Fearow's Drill Peck to 2HKO it. Additionally, Gastly's terrible Ground- and Psychic-type weaknesses leave it OHKOed and 2HKOed, respectively, by most common Earthquake and Psychic in the tier from the likes of Nidoqueen and Gastly. These issues are compounded by Gastly's reliance on the inaccurate Hypnosis, as a miss could mean Gastly faints without doing anything.
Comments: Other Options
Night Shade can be used as a midground option to deal consistent damage to Gastly's switch-ins. It is also Gastly's strongest attack against Psychic- and Fire- types, though Explosion and Psychic are usually better moves against Psychic- and Fire-types, respectively. The utility of Gastly's other attacking moves are also generally superior, and Psychic is already a consistent midground option. Psychic also has the chance to drop the opponent's Special and land a critical hit, which Night Shade cannot do. Gastly can be used as a lead, as it outspeeds lead Porygon and Nidoqueen and is 3HKOed by Arcanine's Fire Blast, which always gives it at least one opportunity to use Hypnosis; Arcanine'sFire Blast puts Gastly into KO range of Fearow's Drill Peck, however, meaning it is easily revenge killed. Given Hypnosis's poor accuracy and Gastly's inability to substantially threaten these foes outside of Hypnosis, lead Gastly is extremely inconsistent.
Checks and Counters
Faster Attackers: Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar all outspeed Gastly. Fearow 2HKOes Gastly with Drill Peck and is only 2HKOed in return by Thunderbolt, while Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar 3HKO Gastly and comfortably take any damage it can throw out in return. These Fire-types can also burn Gastly, making its already middling Explosion even weaker. Magmar deserves a special mention, as it has access to Psychic, which 2HKOes Gastly after a Special drop and isn't prone to missing, unlike Rapidash and Arcanine's Fire Blast. Rapidash can also use Fire Spin to chip Gastly into KO range and can be used to pivot around it. However, these Pokemon must be wary of Hypnosis.
Psychic-types: Although both are uncommon, Abra and Drowzee 2HKO Gastly with Psychic and can cripple it with Thunder Wave. The former outspeeds Gastly and is only 3HKOed by Night Shade, while the latter is only 4HKOed; both take negligible damage from Gastly's other attacks. However, both must watch out for Explosion, which OHKOes Abra and does a minimum of 67% to Drowzee. Due to it being outsped, Drowzee must be wary of Hypnosis.
Magneton: Thanks to its high Special and good bulk, Magneton can switch into Gastly's attacks, taking only 22.4% at maximum from Psychic, and threaten it back with Thunder Wave and a strong STAB Thunderbolt, which has a 19.2% chance to 2HKO. However, Magneton must be wary of Psychic Special drops and Explosion. Magneton is also slower than Gastly, meaning it is susceptible to Hypnosis.
Earthquake Users: Even if Gastly can threaten Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Machamp, and Graveler with Psychic, these foes can tank a hit and OHKO Gastly in return with Earthquake. However, there is no viable Earthquake user in PU that is faster than Gastly, so the majority of them must be wary of Hypnosis and being in Gastly's KO range.
Moveset: Offensive Sleeper
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Hypnosis is one of Gastly's most powerful tools, as its good Speed stat allows it to outspeed and put foes such as Seaking and Porygon to sleep. However, Gastly usually does not want to risk trying to land Hypnosis against foes that can KO it if it misses, such as Nidoqueen. Gastly will only want to use Hypnosis against these foes if it needs to put them to sleep to win later in the game, such as if it needs to beat Fearow Nidoqueen one-on-one, or if it can't afford to take too much damage against certain foes, such as Magneton. If Gastly can afford to, it will much rather just attack rather than try to land Hypnosis, as attacking is far more consistent due to Gastly being too frail to be able to afford to fumble a turn without doing anything, as if it misses, it can end up achieving nothing. Psychic hits Pokemon such as Nidoqueen and opposing Gastly super effectively. Its high chance to inflict a Special drop on the opponent also makes it Gastly's best move against Fire-types and neutral targets. Thunderbolt deals super effective damage to Flying- and Water-types, 2HKOing Fearow, Scyther, and Staryu and 3HKOes Seaking. Substitute enables Gastly to become even more threatening offensively after landing Hypnosis, punishing opponents that stay in to attempt to wake up or sacrifice whatever has been put to sleep. Substitute also has the benefit of the fact that very few Pokemon have access to paralysis-spreading moves, letting Gastly be completely safe behind a Substitute. Explosion lets Gastly sacrifice itself to put a frailer foe into range of a strong revenge killer such as Fearow or Scyther. Explosion comes with the benefit of ending the turn, preventing slower foes such as Porygon and Seaking from healing or setting up. It also allows for win-win scenarios when paired with Hypnosis, as Gastly can explode in front of a sleeping foe to either give its teammates such as Scyther or Seaking free setup turns if the opponent stays in, or if they switch, Explosion will heavily chip whatever has switched in.
Gastly's main role in a team is as a sleeper and Seaking check; it can put a key foe to sleep to clear the way for its teammates while remaining offensively potent even after landing Hypnosis. Gastly can also switch in to Seaking's Surf once and threaten it with Hypnosis and Thunderbolt or use Explosion on it to deny the chance for it to set up an Agility. Gastly can also switch into Scyther with little risk, as it is immune to its Normal-type coverage and is only 4HKOed by Wing Attack while it threatens Scyther in return with Hypnosis and a 2HKO from Thunderbolt; however, Gastly must be wary of Scyther using Swords Dance on the turn it switches in, as a boosted Scyther 2HKOes it with Wing Attack, forcing Gastly to either attempt to land Hypnosis or fish for a critical hit with Thunderbolt. Gastly tends to get overwhelmed by faster threats, so it appreciates partners that can switch into them; Omanyte and Graveler check Rapidash, Fearow, and Arcanine. Gastly is also checked by Graveler and Drowzee and thus enjoys the support of wallbreakers such as Seaking and Arcanine. Gastly's combination of high Special and immunity to Body Slam makes it the best switch-in to Omanyte, making it a great partner to Rapidash and Arcanine. Gastly's good Seaking matchup also makes it a good teammate for these Pokemon.

Overview: Clearly winging it, Golbat doesn't have even the slightest hope of taking flight in PU. Right off the bat, outside of its above-average Speed, all of its stats are below-average to bad. It lacks any powerful attacks or utility options, usually failing to draw blood from its target. In fact, it's completely unable to sink its fangs into Gastly due to its lack of coverage. Its typing is also very subpar, leaving it battered in the face of common Ice-, Psychic-, and Electric-type attacks. While its Speed and access to Confuse Ray are quite solid, the only thing blood curdling about this vampire bat is how terrible it is.
Comments: 
Moveset: Standard
Description: Confuse Ray can give Golbat extra turns, though it's quite unreliable. Screech is the most useful form of utility Golbat has, and it slightly abates its low attacking power. Double-Edge is Golbat's primary means of battering its opponent. Hyper Beam can be used over Screech or Double-Edge as Golbat's most powerful attack. Mega Drain lets Golbat leech health off its target but is only useful as coverage against Rock-types, such as Graveler and Omanyte. While Golbat already does about as much damage as a vampire in the sun, Gastly completely stonewalls Golbat, so checks to it such as Drowzee and Abra make good partners.

Format: UU
Overview: Golduck is the fastest Amnesia user in RBY UU, which gives it the potential to be a fairly terrifying sweeper given the chance. An Amnesia-boosted Golduck is not to be taken lightly: a +2 Blizzard OHKOes Dodrio, as well as Tangela 41% of the time. +2 Blizzard, along with Hydro Pump, will also 2HKO most neutral targets, though there are notable exceptions such as Articuno and Hypno. Amnesia also assists Golduck defensively, making it very difficult for conventional Water-types to KO and allowing it to PP stall them using Rest. Golduck's Speed is also fairly decent—tying it with Articuno and Pinsir—which lets it get the jump on Dragonite before it can set up Agility.
However, Golduck has a myriad of issues that prevent it from seeing play. The main problem is that its good coverage falls flat in RBY UU due to the many bulky Water-types such as Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Dewgong, all of which stonewall Golduck. Furthermore, Tentacruel makes actually getting mileage out of Golduck a nightmare, outspeeding it to delay its setup and chip it down with Wrap until it's placed in KO range. Golduck is fairly vulnerable to physical attackers like Kangaskhan that love to punish its Rest, blowing past it with their STAB moves. As a result, while Golduck works on paper, it flounders in practice. Poliwrath is a far superior pick as an Amnesia user, possessing a wider movepool and better overall stats.
Comments: 
Moveset: Amnesia
Description: Amnesia enables Golduck to function as an offensive and defensive Pokemon, letting it shore up its special bulk to wall Water-types while becoming a very threatening sweeper should its checks be removed. The combination of Hydro Pump and Blizzard is only resisted by opposing Water-types and therefore serves as its best coverage. Hydro Pump will OHKO Dugtrio without a boost, and, at +2, it will OHKO Persian and Kangaskhan. Finally, Rest allows Golduck to remain healthy, continue picking up Amnesia boosts, and remove any paralysis it sustains in the process.
Golduck has a few alternative options, though fitting them into its moveset is very difficult. Body Slam allows Golduck to make use of its nice Attack stat, chipping foes with poor Defense like Kadabra while spreading paralysis. Should a more defensive approach be desired, Ice Beam is a suitable alternative to Blizzard for trying to freeze an opponent's Water-type, like Vaporeon, with freeze having an 81.98% chance of occurring if all of Ice Beam's PP is used. Some think to use Confusion for fighting Tentacruel, but even at +2, it only has a 59.1% chance to 3HKO and is largely useless outside of this.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Gyarados is generally considered good in the current metagame.
<hr>
Gyarados is among the strongest tanks and wallbreakers in RBY UU. Thanks to an impressive base stat total and deep movepool, Gyarados can comfortably stomach powerful attacks and threaten just about the entire tier with a super effective special move or strong physical move. It is equipped to handle many premier defensive and support Pokemon; Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Tangela and can potentially OHKO Dragonite, Thunderbolt puts pressure on Water-type Pokemon like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, and Omastar, and the combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam is more than enough to break through Kadabra and Hypno. Gyarados is no slouch against offensive Pokemon as well, boasting a Hydro Pump that can OHKO Dugtrio and 2HKO Kangaskhan and Persian. It is thus a highly customizable Pokemon that can fit on a wide variety of teams.
Gyarados is also one of the strongest checks to Dugtrio in the tier. With an immunity to Earthquake and several moves that can OHKO or 2HKO it, Gyarados can switch in against Dugtrio and quickly force it out, sometimes several times in the same game. A healthy Gyarados can confidently prevent a Dugtrio sweep and heavily punish switch-ins with strong moves like Body Slam. Gyarados is also the only Dugtrio check that isn’t weak to Ice, meaning it doesn’t exacerbate a team's weakness to Pokemon like Articuno and Tentacruel nearly as much as other options like Dragonite, Aerodactyl, and Tangela. Versus its closest competitor, Dragonite, Gyarados has an additional point of Speed and STAB Water-type moves. Gyarados can thus reliably revenge kill Dragonite and Venusaur and deal more damage to Pokemon such as Kangaskhan and Haunter.
While Gyarados may be able to shake off Blizzard, Thunderbolt absolutely terrifies it. Electabuzz and Raichu are very likely to OHKO Gyarados with the move and Persian, even with its underwhelming Special stat, scores a clean 2HKO. Gyarados’s weakness to Rock can be similarly exploited; while Gyarados is a strong answer to Dugtrio, Rock Slide can deal some hefty damage, especially with a critical hit. Finally, while Gyarados is rather bulky, it lacks any form of reliable recovery, and it isn’t particularly quick. This means that it can be worn down over the course of a match when used too liberally.
Comments: Other Options
While Gyarados will most often run Body Slam and Blizzard, it can potentially drop one to run all of Hyper Beam, Thunderbolt, and Hydro Pump. Body Slam is tough to drop because it is a very consistent midground option, but the additional coverage may be desirable if, for example, Gyarados is being used as more of a revenge killer than a defensive piece. Dropping Blizzard leaves Gyarados unequipped to handle Dragonite, as well as Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela.
Fire Blast is Gyarados’s strongest move against Articuno, scoring a guaranteed 3HKO. It lacks the same coverage as Blizzard, failing to handle Dragonite and Dugtrio, but it reliably handles Grass-type Pokemon and the occasional Bug-type Pokemon like Pinsir or Venomoth. The move also carries a dangerous burn chance, which can severely cripple wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite and physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dodrio. Thunder is another potential special attack, notably scoring an OHKO on opposing Gyarados, possible 2HKO on Omastar and Dewgong, and a guaranteed 3HKO on Vaporeon and Articuno. However, its poor accuracy keeps it from being commonplace.
Because of its bulk and array of strong matchups, Gyarados can run Rest to improve its longevity. The move can make Gyarados a more persistent check to Pokemon like Dugtrio, Dragonite, and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Gyarados can potentially burn sleep turns in front of these Pokemon or during Tentacruel’s Wrap. Rest remains a fairly niche option, however, as many Pokemon can switch in and OHKO or 2HKO Gyarados and it costs Gyarados a valuable coverage move.
Checks and Counters
Electric-type Moves: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode all outspeed Gyarados and have a chance to OHKO it with Thunderbolt. Unless they are paralyzed, these Pokemon will virtually always KO Gyarados or force it to switch. Haunter is another dangerous Pokemon as, in addition to outspeeding and 2HKOing Gyarados with Thunderbolt, it can come in for free on Body Slam and Hyper Beam. Haunter’s high Special also guarantees that it will survive two Hydro Pumps. Persian also outspeeds and 2HKOes Gyarados, but it is more afraid of its special moves. Clefable is also guaranteed to 2HKO Gyarados and Raticate has good odds to do so as well. Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also have the benefit of being immune to Body Slam paralysis, meaning they can switch in more confidently than most Pokemon.
Articuno: Gyarados's Thunderbolt has a 47.1% chance to 3HKO Articuno, and Fire Blast and Thunder guarantee the 3HKO. Articuno, on the other hand, outspeeds Gyarados and 3HKOes with Blizzard. Outside of a Body Slam paralysis or critical hit, Gyarados generally cannot pressure Articuno, meaning Articuno is often free to take it out or set up with Agility and sweep. Without a super effective move, Gyarados struggles to even 3HKO.
Kangaskhan: Kangaskhan outpaces Gyarados and can potentially 3HKO it with either two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. This means Kangaskhan will reliably defeat Gyarados unless it is carrying Hydro Pump; even with Hydro Pump, the matchup is inconsistent due to its mediocre accuracy and the risk of paralysis from Body Slam. Kangaskhan can even potentially switch in against Gyarados, as it can't be paralyzed by Body Slam and has a chance to survive two Blizzards afterward.
Rock Slide: While Gyarados switches into Dugtrio's Earthquake without fear, it must be cautious of Rock Slide. Repeated chip damage from Rock Slide makes Gyarados much less effective as a tank. Moreover, if Dugtrio lands a critical hit, Rock Slide will cost Gyarados over half of its health. Likewise, Golem has little business staying in against Gyarados, but if it predicts the switch or is behind a Substitute, it can hit with Rock Slide and take away over half of Gyarados’s health.
Status Conditions: While Gyarados handles status effects better than other Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Tangela, it still prefers to avoid them. Being poisoned greatly reduces Gyarados's ability to repeatedly switch in and makes it easier to KO; for example, Dugtrio can 3HKO a poisoned Gyarados with Rock Slide. Moreover, Gyarados becomes incapable of stalling partial-trapping moves like Tentacruel's Wrap and Pinsir's Bind. While Fire Blast is not otherwise threatening to Gyarados, being burned similarly reduces its defensive utility and ability to hit and run. Moreover, it cripples Gyarados's offensive presence; a burned Gyarados can't even 2HKO Kadabra. Lastly, paralysis shortens the list of Pokemon that Gyarados can reliably threaten. Pokemon that Gyarados often preys on, like Hypno, Vaporeon, Omastar, and paralyzed Kadabra, handle Gyarados much better when it is paralyzed. Additionally, most of Gyarados's moves have imperfect accuracy, meaning it may have trouble dealing damage when paralyzed. Hydro Pump, for example, has a dismal 59.8% chance to hit if Gyarados is paralyzed. Dugtrio in particular exploits this accuracy problem, as it often carries Substitute and can thus fish for misses or full paralysis.
Water-type Pokemon: Tentacruel is the strongest Water-type check, as it can outspeed and immobilize Gyarados with Wrap; considering Gyarados doesn’t handle chip damage very well, this will usually force it to switch. Without Thunderbolt, Pokemon such as Vaporeon, Omastar, and Dewgong can be tricky, as they can repeatedly use Rest and gradually chip down Gyarados with Body Slam or Blizzard. Opposing Gyarados also become an issue, as Thunderbolt is a clean 2HKO. With Thunderbolt, these matchups are decidedly favorable, but they may result in Gyarados losing some health or being paralyzed, which may inhibit its ability to check Dugtrio.
Moveset: All-out Attacker
Description: Set Description
Body Slam is Gyarados’s primary attack and a great way to spread paralysis; many Pokemon that look to switch into Gyarados, like Electabuzz and Tentacruel, loathe getting paralyzed. This makes it a great option when it comes face to face with Dugtrio and other Pokemon that are likely to switch out. The move is also just generally quite strong thanks to Gyarados’s base 125 Attack stat, which ties Pinsir for the third-highest in the tier. Blizzard is a great deterrent when facing Dragonite that also helps against Pokemon like Venusaur, Tangela, Dodrio, and Aerodactyl. If Gyarados isn’t running Hydro Pump, Blizzard is its best option against Pokemon with poor Special like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan. Hyper Beam is extremely strong and can eliminate many prominent threats pretty early. Tentacruel and Hypno drop to the move when they are just below 50% health and Kadabra can even be OHKOed by it, though it is unlikely. The move is thus a very strong tool for revenge killing, especially against paralyzed targets. Hyper Beam is also great for taking out common switch-ins when they are at low health or as a last-ditch hit. Thunderbolt is a powerful tool against the many bulky Water-type Pokemon in UU, 3HKOing Omastar and Dewgong while 4HKOing Vaporeon. While these Pokemon somewhat threaten Gyarados, especially via Body Slam paralysis, Gyarados can reliably break through them if needed. This is a key advantage Gyarados holds over every other notable Dugtrio check. Funnily enough, Thunderbolt also prevents Gyarados from being walled by opposing Gyarados. Lastly, Hydro Pump is Gyarados’s strongest move, narrowly beating out Hyper Beam. Hydro Pump makes quick work of most weak and neutral targets, notably OHKOing Dugtrio, Golem, and Aerodactyl, 2HKOing Persian and Kangaskhan, and 3HKOing Kadabra, Haunter, and sometimes Hypno. It is also a decent option against Articuno and Omastar if Gyarados isn’t packing Thunderbolt. Selecting Gyarados’s last two moves often comes down to team composition.
Using Gyarados successfully often comes down to getting it in safely, letting it deal as much damage as possible, without worrying too much about its middling speed and lack of recovery. Keeping Gyarados healthy is essential for consistently checking Dugtrio; after taking a mere 16%, Rock Slide will always 3HKO, meaning Gyarados may lose to Dugtrio on the switch if it can't OHKO it. Encouraging Pokemon like Dugtrio, Golem, and Kangaskhan to use Earthquake is a very good way to get Gyarados in, as it will take no damage and force out the first two Pokemon rather consistently. Gyarados can pressure Kangaskhan, especially if it has Hydro Pump, but Kangaskhan may choose to stay in as it can win the matchup with two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam or three Rock Slides. Once Gyarados is revealed, it becomes a very strong deterrent to using Earthquake; for example, Dugtrio is very likely to use Slash or Rock Slide instead, which makes it much easier to manage.
Gyarados is typically reserved for checking Dugtrio before anything else. However, if Dugtrio dealt with or absent from the opponent’s team, Gyarados becomes a lot more flexible. It is quite good at breaking through many common defensive Pokemon and shrugging off their hits; it effortlessly comes in against Surf, which helps it bully Water-type Pokemon like Vaporeon and Omastar late-game. It can also withstand a few Wrap hits from Tentacruel and wait for a miss if it must. Gyarados can prevent every Water-type Pokemon from repeatedly using Rest without really fearing any of their moves. It also comes in quite comfortably against offensively weaker Pokemon like Tangela and Aerodactyl, especially if it can come in on Mega Drain and Fire Blast, respectively. Gyarados also works well as a revenge killer thanks to the power of Hyper Beam and Hydro Pump. It can reasonably KO most slower Pokemon after some damage, but Hypno and paralyzed Kadabra are two particularly common targets, as Gyarados can switch in when they use their recovery moves.
Gyarados partners best with Pokemon that appreciate a reliable switch-in for Dugtrio, like Tentacruel, Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu. They are also all quite good at baiting Dugtrio to use Earthquake, which helps Gyarados get in safely and repeatedly. Electabuzz and Raichu are also good switch-ins against opposing Electric-type Pokemon, with which Gyarados struggles. Persian is another good partner, as Gyarados matches up fairly well against most of its checks and answers: Dugtrio, Omastar, Golem, and Aerodactyl. Aside from Dugtrio, these Pokemon are quite likely to switch into Persian, giving Gyarados an opportunity to come in on a double switch. Articuno, Dragonite, and Dodrio appreciate Gyarados as is a solid answer for the bulky Water-type Pokemon that wall them. These Pokemon also help Gyarados check Dugtrio, allowing it to play more flexibly. Grass-type Pokemon like Venusaur and Tangela switch in comfortably against the Thunderbolts that often target Gyarados, and they too take some pressure off of Gyarados as a dedicated Dugtrio check. Fast sweepers like Dugtrio and Aerodactyl are really good at cleaning up teams after Gyarados has mounted a lot of chip damage by pivoting in against opposing Dugtrio and other Pokemon it threatens. Dugtrio also does a good job at punishing Electric-type Pokemon, Haunter, and Persian, which can threaten Gyarados.

Format: OU
Overview: Gyarados clings to RBY OU relevance thanks to a combination of massively inflated stats, expansive coverage in moves like Thunderbolt and Blizzard, and a unique typing that makes it the only Water-type immune to Ground, letting it switch in on a predicted Earthquake with impunity. That typing lets it synergize with Pokemon like Chansey, Gengar, and Jolteon, which not only appreciate this immunity, but also help patch up its own Thunderbolt weakness. Gyarados's attacking stats are extremely high, allowing it to achieve feats such as 2HKOing Tauros and 3HKOing Snorlax with Hydro Pump, letting it win against them one-on-one. Plus, it's bulky to the point that even a Thunderbolt from Starmie fails to OHKO it without a critical hit. It's not exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, outrunning Pokemon like Cloyster, Dragonite, and Victreebel while threatening them with its coverage. Overall, Gyarados can be seen as a battering ram that blows past paralyzed teams.
However, while it may have been a big threat in the early days of the generation, Gyarados fell out of favor due to its typing giving it some horrendous weaknesses. While its Ground immunity looks enticing to switch in on Rhydon, it also takes huge damage from Rock Slide: its bulk isn't as good as it looks. It also gets a quadruple weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Blizzard and Psychic, making it hard for Gyarados to get in against the special attackers of the tier and forcing teams to make up for it. If paralyzed, this gets even worse, as Gyarados's lack of reliable recovery makes it very easy to wear down as is. Even offensively, because of a criminal lack of physical STAB moves, Gyarados struggles to damage specially bulky Pokemon like Chansey and Gengar. Finally, Gyarados has issues distinguishing itself from Lapras outside of its typing and superior Attack, which has the same coverage and higher overall bulk. As a result of these flaws, Gyarados is a very rare sight in RBY OU, often requiring extensive support from a dedicated team to function properly, but it remains a serviceable pick in the hands of an experienced player.
Comments: Other Options
Surf can be used if Hydro Pump's consistency is problematic, but this reduces Gyarados's immediate threat level. Worse still, it's not that much better than Blizzard in practice damage-wise, making it largely redundant. Thunder is a serviceable option to 2HKO Starmie and Slowbro, but its criminally low accuracy and lack of benefit outside of this make it mostly suboptimal.
Checks and Counters
Gengar: Gengar can switch in on Gyarados and KO it with Thunderbolt if it's taken even a modicum of damage. However, it can't repeatedly switch into Hydro Pump, lest it get 3HKOed in the process.
Chansey: Chansey can effortlessly take Gyarados's special coverage; Reflect sets are also depressing to fight against. Additionally, Chansey's access to Thunderbolt and Thunder Wave makes it very risky for Gyarados to contest unless its moveset has already been successfully scouted. However, Gyarados can KO Chansey with Hyper Beam from 49.3% onwards if Reflect isn't active—even above 75% with Body Slam + Hyper Beam—which makes a paralyzed Chansey very possible to beat.
Starmie and Lapras: While it gets Thunderbolt, Gyarados struggles to deal with Starmie and Lapras due to their Hydro Pump resistance and ability to simply outdamage Gyarados with their own coverage. Starmie is of particular note because of its access to Thunder Wave, which firmly shuts down Gyarados. However, it has to risk Body Slam paralysis when switching in, which can potentially incapacitate it for the rest of the game.
Electric-types and Electric-type coverage: Any Pokemon with Thunderbolt is automatically a Gyarados check. Jolteon and Zapdos cleanly OHKO Gyarados with their STAB Thunderbolts. If Tauros and Persian run Thunderbolt, they can 2HKO Gyarados off the bat, the latter of which is arguably more threatening because of its high critical hit rate. However, all of these Pokemon would rather avoid taking direct damage, as they have mediocre bulk; they win one-on-one, but they are not reliable defensive answers by any means.
Exeggutor: If not running Blizzard, Exeggutor resists both of Gyarados's special coverage options and threatens with massive damage or sleep in return. Even with Blizzard in the equation, a Special drop from Psychic can instantly ruin any chance of Gyarados actually winning. However, Exeggutor doesn't want to take a Blizzard, as it often wants to save its bulk for more pressing matchups, particularly Rhydon and Snorlax.
Moveset: Wallbreaker
Description: Set Description
Gyarados's Hydro Pump is no joke, letting it potentially 3HKO Snorlax and 2HKO Tauros, winning against them one-on-one. However, it should be remembered that Hydro Pump's inconsistency can and will lead to wasted turns. Additionally, Thunderbolt Tauros can tear Gyarados apart anyway, so it must be scouted for first. Thunderbolt gives Gyarados a fighting chance against all Water-types, most importantly Starmie, Cloyster, Slowbro, and Lapras. However, Blizzard can be used to 3HKO Exeggutor instead, which Gyarados otherwise struggles against. Body Slam allows Gyarados to scout for switch-ins while threatening with paralysis, making use of its great Attack stat in the process; this also prevents Starmie, Alakazam, and Jolteon from switching in safely, and it allows Gyarados to pressure Chansey with significant damage on a critical hit. To top it off, Hyper Beam blows past non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam, KOing them from 58% and 63.5% onwards, respectively, which Body Slam can set it up for.
Gyarados functions as an early- or mid-game wallbreaker that forces the opponent into making predictable decisions. It can be brought in early on a predicted Rest from Snorlax—a common sight in the early-game in RBY—then threaten it with Hydro Pump from there to force damage onto the opposing team. Gyarados's high Special and Water resistance make it one of the best Clamp absorbers in the game too, so it's very capable of switching in on a predicted one from Cloyster. Outside of this though, due to its typing, Gyarados's switch-in opportunities are quite limited, mostly being reserved to generic methods like pivoting with partial trapping, gambling on full paralysis, and Explosion. However, Gyarados's typing makes it well-equipped for double switching against Earthquake, allowing it to ease in Pokemon like Jolteon and Chansey if the situation calls for it.

Overview: Hitmonchan has the honor of being the worst fully evolved Fighting-type in a generation where most Fighting-types are terrible. Hitmonchan is an awful Pokemon with almost no redeeming qualities; it's much weaker than other physical attackers such as Fearow, Pinsir, and Machamp, and it lacks the Speed of Fearow and the bulk of the latter two to make any meaningful progress. Outspeeding and 2HKOing Porygon with Submission seems nice, but it is completely outclassed in this role by Machamp. Hitmonchan isn't even guaranteed to beat Porygon one-on-one, since Porygon can paralyze it and use Recover to heal the damage from Submission. Although Hitmonchan can KO Porygon if it hits enough Submissions in a row, the move's terrible accuracy along with the chance for full paralysis makes this unlikely to happen. Since Hitmonchan struggles to beat even the Fighting-weak Porygon, it should be no surprise that most of Hitmonchan's other matchups are awful too. Its terrible Special means it cannot effectively utilize its coverage at all, and it's so specially frail that Drowzee and Abra OHKO it with Psychic; additionally, it's 2HKOed by every Fire-type, Water-type, and Gastly. Agility seems like it's a redeeming quality, as no other Fighting-type has this move, but it does not make up for all of Hitmonchan's downsides. Despite not being a Fighting-type, Seaking outclasses Hitmonchan as a late-game Agility sweeper thanks to its bulk and decent Special.
Comments: 
Moveset: Agility... Sweeper?
Description: Agility is the only reason you'd use Hitmonchan in the first place, since without Agility you might as well just use a better Fighting-type. Submission is Hitmonchan's strongest move, 3HKOing neutral targets such as Fearow, Dragonair, Rapidash, and Seaking, and it has a chance to 2HKO frailer Pokemon such as Staryu and the Fighting-weak Porygon. However, almost all of these Pokemon are still capable of beating Hitmonchan one-on-one. Submission fails to 3HKO bulkier foes such as Arcanine, Machamp, and Nidoqueen. Body Slam hits Nidoqueen and Pinsir for neutral damage and can be used to fish for paralysis. Hitmonchan's fourth move is more flexible. Counter lets Hitmonchan beat Pinsir, but it's very unlikely that any other Pokemon will use a Normal- or Fighting-type move on it. Seismic Toss lets Hitmonchan hit Gastly, which otherwise walls Hitmonchan, and it's also Hitmonchan's strongest move against Nidoqueen. Ice Punch is another option to fish for freeze, but it comes off of Hitmonchan's abysmal base 35 Special.

Overview: Hitmonlee is a Pokemon that should never see the light of day in RBY PU despite a few strong points. Its base 120 Attack and the unique STAB move High Jump Kick seem appealing, as High Jump Kick 2HKOes physically bulky Pokemon like Porygon, Omanyte, and Graveler; at +1, it's guaranteed to OHKO the first two and has a chance to OHKO Graveler. It also outspeeds some of the tier's offensive threats, such as Nidoqueen and Pinsir. However, it just has too many flaws to really make use of its unique traits.
Firstly, all of Hitmonlee's attacking moves are either Normal- or Fighting-type. This makes it difficult for Hitmonlee to damage many foes, but this is especially problematic against Gastly, which is immune to all of Hitmonlee's moves besides Seismic Toss. Hitmonlee's Base 87 Speed falls short compared to offensive threats such as Fearow and Rapidash, which 2HKO it, or Abra, which OHKOes with Psychic. Therefore, Hitmonlee needs extensive paralysis support to work, and it's just not worth it when other Pokemon like Machamp get more mileage out of such a strategy. Finally, its paper-thin defenses mean it has little chance of surviving any interactions, especially against foes that resist High Jump Kick, since Hitmonlee cannot win unboosted. Pretty much the entire metagame can OHKO or 2HKO Hitmonlee regardless of whether or not they can hit it super effectively, so Hitmonlee is best left on the sidelines.
Comments: 
Moveset: Meditate Attacker
Description: High Jump Kick is Hitmonlee's most powerful attack and 2HKOes Pokemon that Hitmonlee outspeeds such as Porygon, Omanyte, and Graveler. One Meditate boost turns the aforementioned 2HKOs into possible or guaranteed OHKOs. Body Slam provides some much-needed coverage and consistency, allowing Hitmonlee to dent switch-ins and spread paralysis without support from teammates. For Hitmonlee's final moveslot, Seismic Toss is the best option, as it lets Hitmonlee actually damage Gastly. As far as other options go, Mega Kick deals higher damage than Body Slam, but comes at the cost of lower accuracy and the paralysis chance that makes Body Slam so valuable. Counter can allow Hitmonlee to net a surprise KO against something like Pinsir's Slash, but is generally unreliable and will only work once due to Hitmonlee's pitiful defenses.

Overview: Despite its pitiful defenses and typing, Hitmonlee finds itself as a niche but quite useful Pokemon in RBY 1v1, thanks to its strong Attack, respectable Speed, and incredibly important matchup against Snorlax, the best Pokemon in the tier.
Comments: Other Options
Counter can potentially be used to improve odds in Normal- and Fighting-type matchups like Machamp, opposing Hitmonlee, and Persian.
Checks and Counters
Tauros: Tauros is faster than Hitmonlee and can find easy 2HKOs with Body Slam and Hyper Beam.
Rhydon: While Hitmonlee can attempt to flinch it with Rolling Kick, it is not very likely, and Rhydon’s Earthquake is a 2HKO. Hitmonlee’s Rolling Kick is a 3HKO, and High Jump Kick has a very low chance to 2HKO Rhydon, so the matchup is in Rhydon's favor.
Pokemon Hitmonlee Cannot Hit Super Effectively: Hitmonlee matches up really poorly against every strong special attacker due to its abysmal bulk, and without any super effective damage, Hitmonlee struggles to break through them. It particuarly struggles against Pokemon with Psychic- and Flying-type moves like Alakazam, Starmie, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Jynx, Gengar and Zapdos.
Moveset: Offensive
Description: Set Description
High Jump Kick is one of Hitmonlee's signature moves and its strongest Fighting-type STAB move, letting it hit Snorlax, Kabutops, Chansey, and Lapras for massive damage. Jump Kick, while not as strong, is slightly more accurate, which helps with securing KOs after a High Jump Kick, especially against Snorlax. Rolling Kick allows Hitmonlee to attempt to flinch its way through slower Pokemon like Rhydon. Both Meditate and Substitute are used to punish a Counter from Chansey or Snorlax, Meditate is preferred for Reflect Chansey, while Substitute helps more against Snorlax.
The main draw of Hitmonlee is how amazing it is against Snorlax and Chansey, two of the best Pokemon in the tier. Because of this, it is best to run teammates that don't like facing Snorlax and Chansey such as Alakazam, Jolteon, Zapdos, Rhydon, Snorlax, and Tauros. These Pokemon can help Hitmonlee in return by beating any threats that might do well against it such as the many Psychic-type Pokemon in the tier.

Overview: Horsea holds a micro-niche in PU as a second, weaker Seaking, acting as an Agility sweeper that threatens many top Pokemon, such as Fearow, Arcanine, and Nidoqueen, with a 2HKO from either Surf or Blizzard. Horsea also has access to Smokescreen, which makes it much harder for Seaking to reliably set up Agility in front of Horsea and sweep. However, Horsea is much frailer and weaker than Seaking, notably being 2HKOed by Slash from Scyther and Pinsir and Thunderbolt from every relevant user. It is also always KOed by Fearow's Double-Edge into Hyper Beam, and it is 3HKOed by Seaking's Double-Edge and Drowzee's Psychic. This frailty makes it much harder for Horsea to set up Agility compared to Seaking, which has enough bulk to reliably set up and sweep. Horsea's Speed is also poor before it sets up, only outspeeding the likes of Drowzee, Vileplume, and Porygon. Being entirely worse than Seaking means it must not be used as a replacement to Seaking, but as a partner to it. The combination of Horsea and Seaking stacks weaknesses to Staryu and Gastly; Staryu is especially problematic as even Double-Edge Seaking struggles to beat healthy Staryu without a critical hit and Horsea is completely useless into Staryu unless it manages to freeze it. Horsea's flaws massively outweigh its short list of benefits, and as a result Horsea should not be used in nearly any serious game.

Moveset: Agility Sweeper
Description: Set Description
Surf is Horsea's strongest move, 2HKOing Nidoqueen and Fire-types and doing decent damage to neutral targets. Surf gets many Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, into KO range of a strong revenge killer, such as Fearow or Scyther. Blizzard 2HKOes Fearow, Dragonair, and Scyther and 3HKOes Vileplume. It can also let Horsea get a lucky freeze on the likes of Staryu or Seaking if desperate. Agility lets Horsea outspeed everything and win many matchups it would otherwise lose, such as against Fearow, Nidoqueen, and Scyther, though it's hard to find setup opportunities. Smokescreen lets Horsea prevent Seaking from using Horsea as setup fodder. Smokescreen can also be used when desperate, as it can let Horsea win poor matchups with enough luck or force a switch. Hydro Pump can be used in place of Surf, as it is much more powerful, notably 3HKOing Drowzee, Porygon, and Machamp.
Horsea cannot be used as a replacement to Seaking; it has to be used alongside it, as Seaking entirely outclasses it. Horsea needs support to be able to deal with Staryu, so Pokemon such as Vileplume and Drowzee make good partners, as they can switch in and incapacitate Staryu with status moves. Seaking should be used early- to mid-game to break and chip down foes for Horsea to KO in the late game. Seaking fainting will likely cause the opponent to value their Staryu less, which will make them more likely to let it take paralysis or faint, making it easier for Horsea to clean. Staryu also makes a good partner to Horsea, as it can remove Seaking, which would otherwise threaten to set up and sweep in front of Horsea. Pokemon with high Special also give Horsea trouble, such as Gastly and Drowzee, so Pokemon that can handle them, such as Drowzee and Arcanine, make good partners for Horsea.

Overview: Hypno holds a niche in the tier as the fastest viable Pokemon that has access to both a sleep-inducing move and a paralysis-spreading move. This allows Hypno to outspeed and put Exeggutor to sleep with Hypnosis as well as paralyze faster foes such as Tauros, Gengar, and Zapdos and attempt to brute-force them with STAB Psychic. Hypno's biggest strength is its role compression, being a jack-of-all-trades lead that covers many matchups at least neutrally, with Thunder Wave being one of the main reasons to use it over Jynx. Thunder Wave even gives Hypno a slight edge over Exeggutor, which has to use the inaccurate Stun Spore; Submission also gives it a better time against Chansey. Hypno has decent bulk, being able to survive a couple stray hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos with relative ease. Hypno's mono-Psychic typing also grants it no common weaknesses, unlike Exeggutor, which has weaknesses to Jynx and Mewtwo's Blizzard and Zapdos' Drill Peck. It also has much better physical bulk than Jynx, which is incredibly physically frail.
While Hypno does fill many roles decently, it fails to do any of these roles particularly well: it's fast enough to outspeed Exeggutor and Lapras but not fast enough to outspeed any other relevant threats, being outsped and completely shut down by Jynx. It's bulky enough to tank a few hits from foes such as Tauros and Zapdos, but it has little staying power due to its lack of recovery. Hypno also has to rely on Hypnosis to put something to sleep, making it somewhat unreliable in getting sleep off. Hypno has heavy competition as a Psychic-type lead, with Exeggutor being the objectively better sleeper, Jynx being faster than it and having STAB Blizzard, and Alakazam and Starmie having Recover. Finally, while Hypno has effectively no weaknesses, it also lacks many of the resistances that Exeggutor has, taking neutral damage from Rhydon's Earthquake, Gengar's Thunderbolt, and Slowbro and Starmie's Surf, making it much worse at switching into those threats.
Comments: Other Options
Meditate can be used in place of Psychic to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis and make Hypno's Submission more powerful, with +1 Submission 2HKOing Chansey and +2 Submission 2HKOing Snorlax 75.4% of the time. However, this set is walled by Gengar and does next to nothing to opposing Psychic-types such as Exeggutor and Mewtwo. Headbutt can be used over Submission on Meditate sets to attempt to paraflinch foes. Headbutt also has higher accuracy than Submission and does more than Submission to Psychic-types but does much less to Chansey and Snorlax and is incredibly unreliable due to only having a 47.5% chance to immobilize a paralyzed foe with Headbutt. Rest can be used in Hypno's fourth moveslot to try and stall out Chansey, Alakazam, and Exeggutor if Sleep Clause is activated, but this is easily exploitable, as Hypno is extremely vulnerable during its sleep turns, becoming setup fodder for Mewtwo, Mew, and Slowbro. Psychic can be dropped in favor of running Submission and Seismic Toss on the same set, as it deals with common Chansey and Exeggutor variants within the same build. It also forces Psychic-types with Rest to use Rest more predictably, which can provide safer switch-in opportunities for Hypno's teammates, although it has a much worse time against Gengar, Tauros, and Zapdos.
Checks and Counters
Faster Sleepers: Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and put Hypno to sleep with relative ease, with Jynx having the opportunity to attempt to freeze something with Blizzard as Hypno switches out. Gengar is less reliable at putting Hypno to sleep than Jynx, and it can be paralyzed and 2HKOed by Psychic if it misses Hypnosis, but it nevertheless is still favored to beat Hypno.
Pokemon with Recovery: Pokemon with recovery moves, such as Alakazam, Starmie, Mew, and Mewtwo, sit on Hypno and exploit its lack of recovery to KO it with ease. However, these Pokemon hate paralysis and will usually avoid a one-on-one interaction with Hypno. Chansey also checks Hypno if it lacks Submission.
Physical Attackers: Most physical attackers beat Hypno one-on-one, such as Snorlax and Mew if Sleep Clause is activated and Tauros if Hypno lacks Counter.
Psychic-types with Rest: Slowbro can switch into Hypno with ease if Sleep Clause is activated, set up on it with Amnesia or paralyze it, and shrug off damage with Rest. Jynx outspeeds Hypno and 3HKOes it with Blizzard, Exeggutor with Rest also walls Hypno, although it can't do much damage to Hypno in return. Opposing Hypno with Rest also walls Hypno without Rest. Slowbro, Jynx, Exeggutor, and Hypno all avoid 3HKOes from Seismic Toss Hypno, letting them Rest loop Hypno and stall it out. However, these Rests are easy to exploit by Hypno switching out as the Rest Psychic-type sleeps.
Moveset: Lead Sleeper
Description: Set Description
Psychic is Hypno's main STAB move, notably 2HKOing Gengar while also doing decent damage to other common leads such as Tauros and Zapdos. Hypnosis is Hypno's only sleep-inducing move, letting it put foes to sleep and notably doing so before Exeggutor can do the same to Hypno. However, it is quite unreliable due to its low accuracy, and Hypno would rather paralyze most faster foes such as Tauros and Gengar with Thunder Wave and attempt to KO them with Psychic. Thunder Wave is a pivotal tool for Hypno, letting it come out victorious in many situations it may not have otherwise. For example, if Gengar misses its Hypnosis, Hypno can paralyze it and 2HKO it with Psychic, while Gengar is either forced to switch out, use Explosion, or attempt to land a second Hypnosis through paralysis, which only hits 44.8% of the time. Seismic Toss deals consistent damage to all foes, notably 4HKOing Exeggutor and Jynx, while Psychic and Submission do paltry damage to them. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, which switches into Hypno with ease if it lacks the move. The recoil from Submission can also be used in your favor, as Hypno can use it to knock itself out before Chansey can heal off the damage with Soft-Boiled, making it easily revenge killed by one of Hypno's teammates such as Snorlax or Tauros. Counter can be used to help against Tauros, as a countered Body Slam followed by a Psychic KOes it, letting Hypno beat Tauros in the one-on-one if it attacks with Body Slam, which Hypno can fail to do without Counter. It's worth noting that Tauros can still beat Hypno with Counter if it goes for Earthquake or flinches it with Stomp. Hypno without Counter also benefits from the mere threat of Counter, with Tauros being wary of using Body Slam on it. A Hypno with a Defense stat of 154 can OHKO Tauros with a countered Body Slam; this is achieved with a Defense DV of 1 and 29 IVs, although a critical hit Body Slam has a 59% chance to OHKO a Hypno with 154 Defense, and Earthquake followed by Hyper Beam KOes Hypno with this reduction in bulk. Hypno is the best anti-lead against lead Mewtwo and also a good anti-lead against the uncommon lead Lapras. Jynx is also a good anti-lead to Mewtwo, but it is OHKOed by Mewtwo's Self-Destruct and 2HKOed by the very rare Fire Blast.

Overview: Hypno has the best typing in RBY, serviceable base stats, and the uncommon ability to spread both sleep and paralysis through Hypnosis and Thunder Wave. While these qualities are good in a vacuum, Hypno is unfortunately outclassed by the most dominant Psychic-types in the tier; Starmie and Alakazam have Recover, while Exeggutor has Explosion, giving all three great options to play out of potentially difficult situations. Hypno, meanwhile, is stuck with Rest as its only recovery option and no way to match or break through its Psychic-type cousins in most scenarios. This means that Hypno struggles both defensively and offensively in practice, failing to find real defensive niches and to threaten much more than Thunder Wave on its Psychic-type foes.
Hypno's niche mostly exists alongside these superior Psychic-types, rather than in their place, offering unusual options its competitors lack or struggle to combine. For example, one may use their Exeggutor to lure a paralyzed target into blocking its Sleep Powder, KO it with Explosion, and then follow up with Hypno's Hypnosis for easy sleep. However, there are two use cases for Hypno as a primary Psychic-type that are worth mentioning. Hypno is better than either Jynx or Exeggutor at sleeping a foe, spreading paralysis, and later absorbing sleep thanks to its decent Defense, which allows it to run Rest without being overwhelmingly punished, thus potentially healing its own paralysis so that it may absorb sleep at a later point. Jynx struggles with using Rest due to its terrible Defense, while Exeggutor struggles because of Ice-type moves breaking its Rest cycles. Hypno's diverse toolkit also includes oddball moves such as Submission, which allows for more pressure on Chansey than the other Psychic-types can usually offer, and it can lead to some extremely favorable scenarios with some lucky paralysis and critical hits. These advantages are incredibly specific and marginal, though, so Hypno is nothing more than a fringe pick in RBY OU.
Comments: Other Options
Hypno can run a moveset of Hypnosis / Thunder Wave / Reflect / Rest, preferably as a lead. It allows Hypno to land Hypnosis, then paralyze any potential switch-ins, and then simply sit in place with Reflect and Rest until the opponent gives in and puts it to sleep, activating Sleep Clause to keep all its teammates safe. However, should this plan not come to fruition, this set can become entirely useless. Other Reflect + Rest sets can also exist, as these moves make Hypno generally hard to take down, but it will generally struggle with making progress due to Hypno's lackluster offense.
Submission allows Hypno to break through Chansey with some luck between full paralysis and critical hits. However, it is pretty much useless otherwise, and the recoil will leave Hypno significantly weakened even if it cripples or KOes Chansey. Nevertheless, due to Chansey's omnipresence, it can be viable to lure it in and break through it with some consistency.
Hypno has access to Meditate, Body Slam, and Hyper Beam, which can theoretically help it break through its Psychic-type walls, but in practice it takes far too long to set up and will usually get KOed before dealing any significant damage. If it elects to run just Meditate + Body Slam or Hyper Beam + Reflect + Rest, then it won't be KOed too quickly, but it also won't be able to break through a vast number of foes, including Gengar, Rhydon, and Reflect Snorlax. Headbutt's 30% flinch chance can give Hypno odds to break through foes in the long run, but it comes at the cost of Base Power.
Hypno can use Toxic in conjunction with Rest to try and defeat its Psychic-type walls through extremely passive stalling, something that standard Hypno cannot achieve by any other means. However, Toxic has proven to be a generally unsuccessful strategy at high level play, with only occasional appearances and no results to write home about.
Counter can be used to try and catch Snorlax and Tauros, but Hypno already struggles for moveslots, and spending one for Counter generally leaves it much less useful in the long term, banking almost its entire utility on the ability to land one Counter.
Checks and Counters
Psychic-types with Recover: Starmie and Alakazam are unthreatened by Hypno's entire movepool bar Hypnosis. Hypno is able to cripple them with Thunder Wave, but it is pretty much forced to switch out immediately after, as it has no prospects in a one-on-one matchup without an extremely unlikely run of Psychic Special drops.
Psychic-types with Rest: While they do not handle Hypno quite as comfortably as Psychic-types with Recover, Rest Jynx, Slowbro, and Exeggutor can generally stop it from making progress, especially if Hypno lacks Seismic Toss. Because Hypno will force them into passivity for a few turns, they are not quite as efficient as other checks. Slowbro deserves a special mention due to its ability to set up with Amnesia against Hypno.
Chansey: While it has to respect the potential for Submission, Chansey is entirely happy against any other Hypno set, and even when Hypno is running Submission, misses and recoil can often lead to its demise.
Physical Attackers: While not as frail as other Psychic-types, Hypno is still not physically bulky enough to shrug off attacks from the likes of Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, unless it is running the rare Reflect. All of these Pokemon can trade hits favorably against Hypno, especially if it ever attempts to use Rest.
Moveset: Double Status
Description: Set Description
Hypno's main draw is Hypnosis, as it incapacitates a Pokemon in a single turn, possibly making one would-be counter into nothing more than a momentum sink. The second best option against these counters is Thunder Wave; this won't help Hypno break through them much, but it will at least enable its teammates to do so. A number of options contest the fourth moveslot: Seismic Toss is the most common and appealing, as it is Hypno's best bet at pressuring Psychic-types. Rest allows it to stick around for longer, shrugging off weaker attacks from many special attackers, though it can be difficult for Hypno to wake up in the presence of strong physical attackers such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon.
Hypno's toothlessness against Alakazam and Starmie can most easily be addressed by an Explosion teammate that can lure and remove them—Exeggutor being by far the most reliable, though Gengar can also lure in the former. Once either is removed, Hypno's sleep and paralysis can actually significantly improve one's odds in the endgame. Endgames are usually left for Pokemon that are very dangerous but also very fragile, such as tier icon Tauros, for which Thunder Wave is often a death sentence. Alternatively, if one really needs to cripple Alakazam, Starmie, or Chansey for a teammate, Hypno's strong Psychic will most often force players to expose one of those three targets to its Thunder Wave, which can be very useful for specific teammates trying to break through them. Ultimately, though, this is no different from Alakazam's ability to force Thunder Wave onto special sponges, and Alakazam outclasses Hypno in most scenarios, so make sure you have further reasons to select Hypno—such as Hypnosis—if your primary goal is to paralyze special sponges.

Overview: Kabutops serves as a powerful physical attacker and defensive check to Fire-types in RBY NU. Its Slash deals heavy damage to most foes, 3HKOing all but the bulkiest Pokemon and notably 2HKOing Mr. Mime. The few that resist it, like Golem, cannot handle STAB Surf, making it very difficult to check Kabutops once it finds entry. Kabutops completely shrugs off burn with Slash, making it by far the most reliable answer to Moltres and Ninetales as well as a tenuous Charizard check. It can also sweep; Swords Dance allows Kabutops to tear through most foes, and it can even set up in front of certain threats, like Blastoise and Moltres. Compared to the other Water-type Swords Dance user, Kingler, Kabutops has less raw power but more switch-in opportunities; its partial Rock typing allows it to catch an opposing Hyper Beam or Explosion and gives it a 4x resistance to Fire, allowing it to effortlessly blockade Moltres and Ninetales. It's also slightly faster, outspeeding Blastoise. In exchange, it loses some defensive utility against Water-types and has difficulty checking Golem, as it cannot switch in safely.
However, Kabutops is a weaker Charizard check than any other Water-type due to its Earthquake weakness; Charizard comes just short of 2HKOing it, so even slight chip allows Charizard to win. Kabutops is just barely too slow to beat threats like Nidoking and Seadra, which win one-on-one thanks to Kabutops's Rock typing. This is also a problem against the slower Kingler, which can 2HKO it with Crabhammer. As with other Water-types, Kabutops piles onto a team's Electrode weakness and takes up the team slot usually reserved for a Ground-type. As the metagame has shifted away from Fire Spin, and threats like Moltres and Ninetales have fallen off, Kabutops has struggled to maintain the dominance it once had, but it is still a fearsome mid-game attacker that is difficult to answer when given the first strike.
Comments: Other Options
Body Slam deals less immediate damage than Slash, but it hits harder after a boost or can be used to fish for paralysis against switch-ins. This is usually less useful than the immediate damage from Slash on most teams, but Water-type spam teams can benefit from it spreading paralysis for allies like Kingler and Seadra. This also lets Kabutops fish for a lucky paralysis in unwinnable endgames against a Mr. Mime or Charizard. Hydro Pump has a solid chance to 2HKO Moltres, but this is unnecessary, since Moltres struggles against Kabutops regardless. Kabutops often does not get a chance to set up with Swords Dance, however, so it can be dropped to have Hydro Pump for rare cases where the extra damage secures a KO on foes like Charizard and Nidoking. Rest can be used to eternally wall Fire-types aside from Charizard, but this is incredibly exploitable by opposing Swords Dance users as well as attackers like Nidoking and Mr. Mime. Blizzard 2HKOes Exeggcute and Fearow, but this is usually a non-issue; Exeggcute is 3HKOed by Slash, making it risky for it to switch in, and Fearow is walled by Kabutops anyway. As with Hydro Pump, this is best substituted over Swords Dance if used. Toxic can be used to prevent Fire Spin shenanigans, since Kabutops can take Fire Spin repeatedly until the foe misses, but this is usually overkill compared to simply hitting them with Surf.
Checks and Counters
Fast Attackers: Mr. Mime and Electrode outspeed and 2HKO Kabutops, and their high critical hit rates are an additional headache. Nidoking and Seadra also outspeed it; these matchups are mutual 2HKOs and 3HKOs, respectively. Raticate loses one-on-one most times but can fish for a critical hit with Thunderbolt; the odds are relatively high, and even if it fails, it will inflict heavy damage. However, all of these checks have difficulty switching in, as Slash 2HKOes or 3HKOes them all.
Venomoth: Venomoth can easily put a stop to any shenanigans with Sleep Powder, and it can switch in relatively safely if Kabutops comes in early-game. Slash does have a small chance to 2HKO Venomoth, so Kabutops can occasionally get away with a Slash + Hyper Beam combination should Venomoth miss with Sleep Powder.
Clefable: Clefable, while slower, is bulky enough to paralyze Kabutops and finish it off with Thunderbolt. This is a relatively wasteful use of it, however, so it's a last resort.
Kingler: Kingler's Crabhammer 2HKOes Kabutops, and it only 3HKOes in return with Slash. However, Kingler cannot switch in and win, and it may give Kabutops a free setup opportunity. Crabhammer can also miss, immediately losing the matchup.
Charizard: Charizard's Earthquake comes just short of 2HKOing Kabutops, which means Charizard actually has several paths to win and can even potentially set up in front of Kabutops. A critical hit guarantees the 2HKO on Kabutops, as does slight chip damage; any stray hit from Charizard's allies will do it, as will two Fire Blasts. Charizard also wins if it uses Swords Dance or Earthquake as Kabutops switches in; should Kabutops switch into a Swords Dance, Charizard can use it again, take a hit, and then OHKO Kabutops, potentially sweeping afterward, as very little can survive a +4 Hyper Beam.
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Slash 2HKOes frail foes like Mr. Mime and Raticate and 3HKOing everything else of note. Swords Dance and Hyper Beam give it a stronger option to sweep late-game; at +2, Kabutops OHKOes the aforementioned Pokemon and has decent odds to OHKO Venomoth and Electrode, so it can become quite the threat if given a free turn. +2 Hyper Beam also deals massive damage to Clefable, Blastoise, and Kingler, allowing Kabutops to soften these threats for teammates before going down or outright KO them if chipped. Surf mostly serves to cover Golem, Nidoking, and opposing Kabutops, but it also matters against Charizard, as Slash is only a 3HKO.
Kabutops functions best as a mid-game wallbreaker or late-game sweeper. As a wallbreaker, Kabutops looks to find entry against slower foes and either tear through them with Slash or set up with Swords Dance and deal as much damage as possible before going down. It excels in this role against paralyzed Mr. Mime and Raticate, especially if they're chipped heavily, and it can also trade hits with Blastoise. Moltres and Ninetales are ideal entry points, of course, and Kabutops may also be able to riskily enter against Charizard; it also can switch into a predicted Hyper Beam from Charizard, Clefable, or Raticate and punish them heavily. Once in, Kabutops exploits the fact that switching into its Slash is nearly impossible; only opposing Kabutops and the incredibly rare Gastly can switch in well, as physically bulky Pokemon like Clefable and Kingler cannot win one-on-one if they take a hit on entry. Exeggcute can switch in once and attempt to paralyze it or put it to sleep, but it's 3HKOed even if it switches into Surf, so a single miss leaves it in severe peril.
As a late-game sweeper, Kabutops looks for endgames in which it can set up Swords Dance and cleave through the enemy team with Hyper Beam. This usually requires faster foes like Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Nidoking to be chipped or paralyzed; once this happens, Kabutops merely needs a chance to set up without getting paralyzed. This is often difficult to achieve, as Kabutops's best setup targets tend to trade hits and get KOed early- or mid-game. Thus, it may choose to skip setting up even late-game and just attack with Slash or Surf to try to close out a game. Kabutops should be played more defensively if the opponent reveals a Moltres, Ninetales, or Fire Spin Charizard, as it freely enters against both Fire Blast and Fire Spin. However, it can be worn down over time, especially if the foe connects with Fire Spin to freely escape.
Kabutops typically fits as the sixth Pokemon on a "Big 5" team—that is, Clefable, Mr. Mime, Blastoise, Charizard, and Venomoth—but it can also be used as part of a "Water-type spam" core, with Seadra or Kingler substituting for Charizard, or on structures using a Ground-type over Charizard to provide support against Electrode. As part of a "Big 5" team, it benefits from paralysis spread by Venomoth, Mr. Mime, and Clefable, all of which can also soften up foes for Kabutops to later sweep through. Seadra appreciates Kabutops's ability to remove Blastoise for it, opening the way for an Agility sweep. Ground-types easily switch into Thunderbolts and Thunder Waves aimed at Kabutops. Pinsir is a rare but interesting option, as Pinsir's Earthquake resistance covers for Kabutops, which easily switches into Fire Blast for Pinsir. However, this structure is extremely vulnerable to Charizard, especially if it simply uses Swords Dance in front of Pinsir.

Format: OU
Overview: Kabutops is a very dangerous Pokemon and among the best Swords Dance users in OU. First of all, its base 115 Attack stat is very respectable, and it sports the best high critical hit rate move in the game—Slash. While this may seem counterproductive for Swords Dance, since in RBY critical hits ignore stat boosts, it means Kabutops can pose an immediate threat without having to raise its Attack. Slash also gives it wallbreaking potential, mostly because critical hits also ignore Reflect. Because Kabutops can switch in on recovery moves such as Rest and Recover and immediately pose a threat, it commonly forces the opponent to switch in a check that lacks recovery, like Exeggutor or Tauros, to force it out. This means Kabutops will do permanent damage. Its typing grants it a valuable resistance to Normal and Ice. This means it can freely set up against Pokemon such as Cloyster, sometimes against Chansey without Thunderbolt (depending on circumstance, the threat of Thunder Wave may pose a problem) and on any variant of Snorlax not packing Earthquake—or the very rare Thunderbolt.
However, while Kabutops's typing is certainly one of its key assets, it also leaves it with very unfortunate weaknesses to Electric and Ground. This means it can't switch in as much as it would want against Rhydon despite its Surf and good Defense. Also, Kabutops is easy to force out with Thunderbolt users such as Jolteon, Zapdos, Gengar, Starmie, and Lapras—the first four outspeed it, and Lapras easily survives a +2 Hyper Beam. Kabutops can struggle to discourage them from switching in, giving them great momentum. Surf is weak enough against them to almost give a free switch. A Hyper Beam use can be punished by Gengar, while Swords Dance usually gives free entry to Thunderbolt users. Every move besides Slash is fairly easy to punish—and Gengar even ignores that, countering Kabutops outright. Slash is still a great move and helps deter these threats, but again its critical hits ignore Swords Dance boosts. Therefore, if these threats can pressure Kabutops into using Slash often, they reduce its threat ceiling in practice. Also, Hyper Beam's 10.4% miss chance or Kabutops's 15.6% critical hit rate can just ruin its sweep, a likely scenario if Kabutops is expected to KO several Pokemon consecutively.
Comments: Other Options
Body Slam can be used to paralyze switch-ins, potentially paralyzing a Pokemon such as Starmie or Exeggutor and thus facilitating a sweeper like Rhydon, but it is difficult to drop one of the listed moves. Dropping Surf means losing to Rhydon and not being able to damage Gengar at all. Dropping Slash makes Kabutops's job of wallbreaking much harder, with it unable to reliably get past Reflect Snorlax and Chansey or hit switch-ins hard, and dropping Swords Dance or Hyper Beam severely hinders its sweeping capabilities. Blizzard may also seem a good choice, but missing out on the OHKO on Rhydon is very detrimental, and Slash hits Exeggutor and Zapdos harder.
For a completely different approach, a more defensive set using Rest, Slash, Surf, and either Reflect or Body Slam could be used. It makes use of Kabutops's key resistances to Normal and Ice, with Slash allowing it to not forfeit momentum. However, Reflect is generally only useful against Earthquake from Tauros and Snorlax, the former having a very high critical hit rate anyway and the latter often forgoing Earthquake for overall more useful moves, giving Reflect fringe utility at best. However, Body Slam is fringe too: it moves Kabutops away from purer defense towards a sort of offensive support role, a less unique role that other Pokemon such as Snorlax and Rhydon fulfill better. They don't need to sacrifice as much of their offensive presence—remember that this Kabutops set drops Swords Dance and Hyper Beam—to be physical walls or lure in and paralyze certain threats.
Checks and Counters
Gengar: Gengar is undoubtedly the best Kabutops counter, since it can easily come in on any of Kabutops's moves and threaten it directly with Thunderbolt. It easily takes Kabutops down, even while paralyzed, since Surf is a 5HKO. If Sleep Clause is not in effect and no statused Pokemon can safely switch in, Gengar can also safely go for Hypnosis to punish the switch-in.
Electric-types: Zapdos outspeeds Kabutops and has a 61.5% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt. If Zapdos is paralyzed, it's a check at best though, because Slash and +2 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO. Jolteon only has a 2.4% chance to OHKO with Thunderbolt, but its critical hit rate is very high and should be kept in mind. However, if Jolteon is paralyzed or asleep from Rest, it can no longer switch in either, because both Slash + Hyper Beam and +2 Hyper Beam are almost always a KO.
Starmie: Starmie is never OHKOed by Slash + Hyper Beam or +2 Hyper Beam, which means it can easily come in and threaten Kabutops with Thunder Wave, Thunderbolt, or to a lesser extent even Surf and Psychic. However, if it's paralyzed, it has to watch out.
Exeggutor: Exeggutor needs Mega Drain to counter Kabutops, since it is almost always KOed by Slash and +2 Hyper Beam. Otherwise, sets without it can come in once and threaten with a status move—or even heavy damage with Psychic.
Victreebel: Razor Leaf OHKOes Kabutops, and Kabutops cannot realistically expect to KO Victreebel even if it switches in, since a +2 Hyper Beam only has a 1 in 39 chance to OHKO. Much like Gengar, it can somewhat safely go for Sleep Powder if circumstances allow for it.
Lapras: Lapras checks Kabutops in a similar way to Exeggutor, with the notable difference that it can generally switch in twice instead of once, and Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 2HKO. It can also use Sing similarly to Gengar.
Moveset: Standard
Description: Set Description
This set makes Kabutops a very menacing threat in OU, although the reasons why may not be immediately apparent. While Slash does not benefit from Swords Dance boosts, it comes off of a very high 115 base Attack stat, which allows it to immediately threaten a paralyzed Alakazam or Chansey (and Starmie to a lesser extent), as well as Rest Snorlax. If the former two have full paralysis on a recovering turn or Kabutops comes in on Rest from the latter, the opponent will be forced to switch them out, most likely to a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Tauros that takes permanent damage. Slash is not a 3HKO on Snorlax, but Snorlax cannot just stall Kabutops with Rest because it is too easy to predict the Rest and use Swords Dance. Once Kabutops is at +2, two Slashes and a Hyper Beam KO Snorlax after Rest before it can attack, forcing Snorlax to switch or risk fainting. Even if Snorlax uses Reflect, it offers little protection because Kabutops has plenty of opportunities to boost to +4. Alternatively, Kabutops can fish for a critical hit with Surf while Snorlax is asleep—a viable strategy considering Kabutops's respectable critical hit rate.
The benefits of Slash don't end here, though. Slash with +2 Hyper Beam is enough to KO Zapdos and Tauros 100% of the time, as well as Exeggutor 95.4% of the time. If Chansey is at 88.6% health, Slash + Hyper Beam becomes a guaranteed KO. At 84.4%, Slash becomes a guaranteed 2HKO too, so a little bit of chip damage comes a long way in breaking through Chansey.
Kabutops also packs a big, big punch as a late-game sweeper. +4 Hyper Beam is a guaranteed KO on Exeggutor and anything more frail than it. With a bit of chip damage, +2 Hyper Beam KOes Starmie and Chansey. Kabutops is not very hard to find setup opportunities with, either: any sleeping Pokemon such as Rest Cloyster, Snorlax, or Jolteon (provided it comes in on the latter's Rest turn) will do. Sleep fodder your opponent is trying to sack, a Rhydon switching out fearing Surf, and an untimely full paralysis are other possible setup windows.
Kabutops also distinguishes itself from other setup sweepers because paralysis does not end its usability in the game. While its late-game sweeping abilities are hindered, its respectable Speed means it's still very capable of beating several Pokemon such as Chansey, Snorlax, Cloyster, and paralyzed Alakazam, using Swords Dance to reapply the latter's paralysis Speed drop and outspeed it. Paralyzed Kabutops also still does significant damage with Slash to potential switch-ins.
Kabutops's typing plays a key role in the Tauros matchup, and typing is perhaps the main asset it has over Sandslash and Kingler. Kabutops's Rock typing means that Tauros will generally resort to Earthquake to beat it, or the much rarer Thunderbolt. Not only does Earthquake have a mere 2.2% chance to 2HKO, it will also never OHKO a full health Kabutops with a critical hit. Sandslash is always 2HKOed by Tauros's Blizzard and OHKOed if it's a critical hit, while Kingler taking on Tauros is likely to find itself paralyzed by a neutral Body Slam, severely hindering its ability to continue the sweep. Earthquake also comes without a freeze or paralysis chance, which gives Kabutops much better odds at late-game sweeping. Unboosted Kabutops can even beat Tauros one-on-one in some situations, usually winning if Tauros is damaged by Slash beforehand or switches in on it. Kabutops also has the most reliable way of disposing of Rhydon and Golem with Surf, since Kingler's Crabhammer has unreliable accuracy, and Sandslash must be at +4 to always OHKO with Earthquake, but this comes the expense of being worse against Gengar.
Lastly, Kabutops also has good synergy with Electric-types such as Zapdos. They can seriously threaten each other's counters, and most players will switch Rhydon in without second thought upon sight of Zapdos, allowing for a double switch to Kabutops and subsequent threat of a setup sweep.

Overview: Kabutops is a powerful Swords Dance user that 2HKOes some of the tier's main defensive Pokemon, like Hypno, Vaporeon, and Tentacruel, with +2 Hyper Beam. It also has access to Slash, which gives it a powerful unboosted attack. Additionally, Kabutops resists Normal- and Ice-type attacks, thereby allowing it to be used in conjunction with Haunter to use against Wrap users like Dragonite. It can also switch into Hyper Beam for a free setup opportunity.
However, even with a fearsome Hyper Beam, Kabutops is not very good in the RBY UU metagame due to the existence of Omastar, which is better defensively, in addition to it being weak to Thunderbolt from Gyarados, Persian, Haunter, and Electabuzz, as well as a weakness to Earthquake and Grass-type attacks. Not to mention, it is outsped by half the metagame. Finally, it has a mediocre Special stat, thus weakening special attacks, and has no Rock-type STAB moves. Due to these flaws, you likely will not be seeing Kabutops running around in RBY UU.

Moveset: Mixed Sweeper
Description: If you decide to run Swords Dance, you should look for an opening to set up and try to sweep or wallbreak. While Hyper Beam does more damage, Body Slam mitigates the fear of a recharge turn, and it can paralyze. Slash can work when Kabutops has no boost, but Body Slam can also work with Hyper Beam, as Slash is unaffected by Swords Dance, but it can work well regardless of if Kabutops is unboosted or not running Swords Dance. On the other hand, while Body Slam does less damage, the chance to paralyze can do much more. Blizzard is used to 2HKO Dragonite, Tangela, and Dodrio.
Alternatively, Kabutops can go for a hit-and-run playstyle with a Rest set, taking advantage of its resistances to Normal- and Ice-type moves. When using Rest, Slash is Kabutops's go-to attacking option, hitting most Pokemon neutrally while doing good damage. You could feasibly use Kabutops to resist Wrap and possibly either use Haunter in the same team to PP stall the Wrap user or Body Slam, Hyper Beam and Blizzard to break out. It is recommended to use Wrap to burn off sleep turns, but this can also be done with other Normal-type moves, especially Hyper Beam, or Blizzard.
Submission is a possible option that works with Swords Dance to hit Kangaskhan, Persian, and Omastar. Mega Kick can be used as a weaker version of Hyper Beam that has no recharge. However, due to the fact that it is weaker than Hyper Beam, it can end up being the difference between a sweep or not. Not to mention it can't OHKO Electabuzz or Raichu after a Swords Dance, whereas Hyper Beam can.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Kangaskhan is generally considered good in the current metagame.
<hr>
Kangaskhan is one of the strongest Normal-type attackers in RBY UU, featuring a wide arsenal of attacking options that help it excel as the tier's most terrifying wallbreaker. Fitting on many offensive teams, it can blow past any Pokemon with Hyper Beam from around 60% HP. It has great coverage too: even the dreaded Articuno, which it outspeeds, is 2HKOed by Rock Slide. The damage that Kangaskhan dishes out is enough to knock many Pokemon into KO range for revenge killers like Dugtrio—if it doesn't just KO them outright—making defensive threats like Vaporeon and Hypno very wary. It is an extremely difficult Pokemon to switch into, arguably having no counters. Not only that, Kangaskhan has incredible physical bulk, allowing it to take minimal damage from Wrap and serve as a minor check to Dugtrio. Kangaskhan is quite customizable for teams as well, possessing interesting options such as Counter.
Despite these incredible positives, Kangaskhan isn't an automatic addition to teams. Its special bulk is simply horrific, leaving it at least possibly 2HKOed by many of the strong special attacks thrown around in the tier, such as Articuno's Blizzard and Tentacruel's Surf. Worse still, it falls short in Speed, being slower than tier-king Tentacruel; factoring in its special fragility, this leaves it easily revenge killed. These factors make Kangaskhan sweeping on its own quite rare, so it will often be reserved to exploiting slower, sleeping, or paralyzed Pokemon.
Comments: Other Options
Substitute is notable, as Kangaskhan's 103 HP Substitutes can tank Night Shade from Haunter, as well as Seismic Toss from Hypno and Kadabra, while easing prediction. However, they will normally default to other moves, such as Thunder Wave or Hypnosis, making the option largely moot. Surf allows Kangaskhan to 2HKO Golem and 3HKO Aerodactyl but has no utility otherwise. Kangaskhan can amp up its damage output with Double-Edge to 3HKO Hypno—or even Mega Kick to 3HKO Vaporeon—but whatever move gets replaced will often be sorely missed; replacing Body Slam makes Kangaskhan far more reliant on paralysis support, and eschewing coverage is generally not advised.
Checks and Counters
Paralysis: Paralysis is the main obstacle to Kangaskhan's success, as it aims to take advantage of slower Pokemon like Vaporeon, as well as paralyzed Pokemon, and tear them down. Paralysis not only makes such interactions impossible but also exposes Kangaskhan's awful special bulk. Pokemon like Articuno, Gyarados, Omastar, Vaporeon, and Venusaur blow paralyzed Kangaskhan away with their strong STAB moves. As such, paralysis inducers such as Kadabra, Electabuzz, and Hypno are to be avoided unless Kangaskhan is in a position where it can KO them first. There will be many times where Kangaskhan will KO something mid-game and subsequently be forced out by one of these Pokemon.
Tentacruel: Tentacruel outspeeds Kangaskhan and has an 82% chance to 2HKO it with Surf. Furthermore, Tentacruel is capable of chipping Kangaskhan into 2HKO range with just one Wrap use, which is what makes the Speed factor so dangerous; while Kangaskhan is absolutely capable of using Earthquake to 2HKO Tentacruel, it cannot do so quickly enough without Tentacruel being paralyzed first or happening to miss Wrap. Even then, Tentacruel may simply go for the Surf 2HKO, as the odds aren't terrible with even a little chip damage. It should be noted that Kangaskhan's Hyper Beam deals more damage than Earthquake, and can KO Tentacruel from 56.4% or less.
Tangela: Tangela isn't afraid of switching into Kangaskhan, not even fearing a critical hit Hyper Beam. Not only does it shrug off these generally nuclear blows, but it can also threaten with Sleep Powder or Stun Spore in return, both of which put an end to Kangaskhan's rampage. Furthermore, if Kangaskhan has been put to sleep, Tangela sets up Growth with impunity, making its Mega Drain noticeably more threatening. Finally, with Bind, Tangela can exploit paralyzed Kangaskhan relatively well, chipping it into KO range and pivoting to its teammates.
Articuno: If Kangaskhan lacks Rock Slide, Articuno is a very deadly threat to its success. Even Ice Beam from Articuno can 2HKO it, and Blizzard makes it impossible to switch Kangaskhan into anything later. If Kangaskhan does have Rock Slide, Articuno is threatened with a 2HKO, though Kangaskhan will be damaged heavily by Blizzard in the process. Without Rock Slide, Kangaskhan can only win with a critical hit Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam. If Articuno has set up Agility and hasn't been damaged, even Rock Slide Kangaskhan cannot win without getting extremely lucky.
Counter Users: Kangaskhan's wallbreaking prowess comes back to bite it with Counter's existence. There will be many points where a Kangaskhan user has to check for Counter by using Earthquake to force it to fail. Pokemon like opposing Kangaskhan, Hypno, and Poliwrath are occasionally seen using the move. Should Kangaskhan trigger Counter, it will take significant damage. There is also the risk of a Pokemon switching in on Hyper Beam and countering the damage the next turn, which may deal fatal damage.
Dragonite: While it fears Blizzard, Rock Slide, and Body Slam paralysis, Dragonite can switch into Kangaskhan's STAB moves comfortably. In return, it can threaten with Thunder Wave or a 3HKO from its own Blizzard.
Aerodactyl: Aerodactyl is the only Pokemon in the game to resist the combination of Normal- and Ground-type coverage; if Kangaskhan's fourth move doesn't cover it, it becomes a serviceable check. Aerodactyl can use Fire Blast to attempt to burn Kangaskhan in this situation, which is a death sentence if it works. The damage isn't small either; it's a guaranteed 4HKO. However, if Kangaskhan does cover Aerodactyl with Blizzard or Rock Slide, it's generally fine. The risk of Body Slam paralysis is very large for Aerodactyl, which makes it very risky to check Kangaskhan with it.
Moveset: Wallbreaker
Description: The combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam will KO Electabuzz, Persian, and Dugtrio. Furthermore, Hyper Beam alone will OHKO Kadabra, and it has a minute chance to OHKO Dugtrio. Body Slam is crucial for Kangaskhan's success outside of damage, as paralyzing a switch-in will often lead to Kangaskhan beating it outright. Earthquake covers Haunter and Omastar, which are 2HKOed and 3HKOed. It further covers Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu as well, which are also 2HKOed. Lastly, Earthquake makes it much easier for Kangaskhan to scout for Counter users like opposing Kangaskhan and Poliwrath, which can be the difference between winning or losing the game.
Kangaskhan's fourth move is largely dependent on its team and what threats the player wants it to cover. No option is truly better than the other. Rock Slide will 3HKO Gyarados and Aerodactyl as well as 2HKO Articuno, the latter of which otherwise wins consistently due to its nuclear Blizzard. Counter enables Kangaskhan to use its high HP to check Normal-type attackers, heavily deterring the use of moves like Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Slash. It also gives Kangaskhan some extra utility, as switching into Hyper Beam and countering during the recharge can be a very strong tactic. Blizzard acts as coverage for Dragonite, 2HKOing it; however, Kangaskhan should be wary of taking a Thunder Wave if attempting this. Blizzard also 3HKOes Aerodactyl, Tangela, and Golem, the latter of which takes more damage than it would from Earthquake. It should not be used against Venusaur or Victreebel, as they take more damage from Body Slam.
Kangaskhan is a wallbreaker at heart and should mostly be kept to this role. Kangaskhan is one of the best ways to punish Rest in the tier, and taking advantage of this is often key to its success: it's capable of 3HKOing even Hypno with two Body Slam uses followed up by Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Body Slam can 3HKO it a third of the time anyway. Similarly, a paralyzed Kadabra attempting to use Recover provides Kangaskhan with the perfect opportunity to switch in for free and threaten to OHKO it with Hyper Beam. Switching in on Seismic Toss against paralyzed Hypno or Kadabra is also valid, as they're forced to take a heavy hit from Kangaskhan. Kangaskhan is excellent at punishing greedy setup as well, switching in on Pokemon like Dodrio as they use Agility to completely reverse the game's momentum. It can also punish players looking to use Hyper Beam to finish Pokemon off early; Kangaskhan's amazing physical bulk allows it to switch in and punish the recharge with massive damage, even if it lacks Counter. It's good to switch Kangaskhan in after having a partner use Rest too, as players attempting to exploit the Rest will often switch in Pokemon like Persian and Dugtrio, which Kangaskhan excels against. The damage Kangaskhan can deal to a team is immense, so determining when it's appropriate to glean value from it early- to mid-game while avoiding paralysis is an important fundamental for players to learn.
Kangaskhan appreciates paralysis support, as well as a reliable sleeper, though neither of these is necessarily required. Consequently, paralysis inducers such as Hypno, Dragonite, Kadabra, and Electabuzz are good partners. Kangaskhan pairs well with other sweepers—particularly those that are stonewalled by a particular Pokemon, including Articuno, Dugtrio, Dodrio, and Persian. Kangaskhan is very capable of overwhelming Pokemon like Haunter, Omastar, and Vaporeon, which typically stand in the way of at least one of these examples. Always remember to fine-tune teams in response to Kangaskhan's fourth move; for example, pairing Counter Kangaskhan with users of Explosion, such as Golem and Haunter, lets you smash a KOed Pokemon's replacement by countering your own Explosion. Haunter particularly pairs well, as it and Kangaskhan together can minimize Wrap's damage to a team by PP stalling it. Haunter also provides the aforementioned sleep support to shut down a potential check, such as Hypno or Kadabra. It can also lure in Pokemon that really don't want to fight Kangaskhan, like Dugtrio. Tangela is a suitable partner for its ease of spreading paralysis, good Dugtrio matchup, and amazing bulk allowing Kangaskhan to be significantly more aggressive. This role compression often gives space for more powerful Kangaskhan partners, such as Articuno and Dugtrio. Venusaur can act similarly to Tangela while further appreciating Kangaskhan's presence, as double switching to Kangaskhan punishes its usual Psychic-type switch-ins hard.

Overview: Kangaskhan is often labelled as a "second Tauros", and while Tauros is usually a better Normal-type attacker, Kangaskhan is not unusable and this label belies how differently it can act in practice. Kangaskhan is much more expendable during a game, fulfilling tasks that are normally too risky for the king of RBY OU. When compared with Tauros, Kangaskhan has some unique moves that make it more effective for this role as well, although they can be difficult to fit onto a set. For instance, Counter helps it oppose Normal-type attackers, and Mega Kick 2HKOes Chansey. Furthermore, Kangaskhan has formidable defensive bulk, which makes it more effective at switching into Body Slam, which cannot paralyze it.
However, Kangakhan's hefty Normal-type competition does make it redundant on most teams. It has awful Special, completely failing to take strong neutral hits from Pokemon like Alakazam, Starmie, and Zapdos. Consequently, it's very challenging to switch Kangaskhan in against a lot of the tier, as one wrong move can mean significant damage; it often requires a double switch. Worse still, its Speed is just below what would be desirable to sweep, which makes it very reliant on extensive paralysis support to face these strong, fast special attackers. Overall, while Kangaskhan is not a replacement for Tauros by any stretch of the imagination, it retains a small niche when used alongside it, forming a strong wallbreaking core.
Comments: Other Options
Kangaskhan's fourth moveslot is the most flexible, and it has a movepool to make use of it. Substitute is an interesting option to relieve prediction because Kangaskhan's HP gives it 103 HP Substitutes, just like Rhydon. This makes Kangaskhan a difficult adversary for Chansey, forcing it to use Seismic Toss twice to break its Substitute. However, Kangaskhan is vulnerable to paralysis throughout these interactions due to Substitute not blocking status in RBY, so it should only be attempted if Chansey is already paralyzed as well. Mega Kick is a valid option for 2HKOing Chansey, Starmie, and Tauros, but it can be difficult to fit into a set, and a miss often leads to Kangaskhan's demise. Rock Slide is another tempting option, allowing Kangaskhan to 2HKO Articuno and Jynx as well as 3HKO Zapdos 47.1% of the time, but it is very matchup-reliant. Thunderbolt is another valid option strictly for beating Cloyster, with two hits putting it in KO range for Hyper Beam. Alternatively, Thunder can 2HKO it after Body Slam.
Kangaskhan is capable of using Counter to check Snorlax and Tauros, making them liable to KO themselves if they use Body Slam. Counter also lets Kangaskhan switch in on Hyper Beam, take it very well, and KO the user while it recharges. However, Kangaskhan's exploitable Special makes it deceptively difficult to find situations where Counter can be used. For instance, Kangaskhan is one of the few Pokemon where it's optimal for Tauros to use Blizzard instead of Body Slam before using Hyper Beam. Kangaskhan even takes relatively high damage from Ice Beam Snorlax. With the two most relevant targets for Kangaskhan's Counter being fully capable of scouting for it, it requires patience to pull off.
Checks and Counters
Strong Special Attacks: The main reason Kangaskhan doesn't see much high-level usage is because of how awful its Special is. Many Pokemon in RBY OU, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Starmie, Alakazam, and more, will 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, few of these Pokemon appreciate switching into Body Slam, as getting paralyzed or critically hit could let Kangaskhan subsequently blast them away with Hyper Beam. Bulkier special attackers like Slowbro and Lapras don't mind Hyper Beam much, though, and can often muscle past Kangaskhan with their STAB moves. Zapdos deserves a special mention for being immune to Earthquake and threatening a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.
Paralysis: While Kangaskhan loves facing paralyzed Pokemon, this also means it wants to avoid paralysis itself. Ergo, Kangaskhan will often find itself being forced out by paralysis inducers like Jolteon, Zapdos, Alakazam, and Chansey, at least if it can't KO them first. If Kangaskhan is paralyzed, it becomes significantly more vulnerable to 2HKOs from special attackers like Exeggutor and Lapras. Ideally, Kangaskhan should only get paralyzed if it's a do-or-die situation.
Tauros Checks: Due to the dominance of Tauros in RBY OU, the tier is already well-equipped for dealing with Kangaskhan. Cloyster has amazing physical bulk, which makes it difficult for Kangaskhan to break past. Even Thunder is only a 3HKO, while Cloyster has an 84.7% chance to 2HKO in return with Blizzard and can recover the damage with Rest. However, Cloyster dislikes switching into Body Slam due to the potential paralysis making it difficult for it to utilize Clamp later on. To Kangaskhan's credit, it's capable of breaking past Cloyster with Thunderbolt or Thunder, although this isn't reliable. Slowbro possesses the physical bulk to trade blows with Kangaskhan, effortlessly paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and get Amnesia boosts on it. However, a Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan will KO it from 44.2% on a maximum damage roll, so it can be a high-variance matchup. Reflect Snorlax is another thorn in Kangaskhan's side, shrugging off anything thrown at it and forcing Kangaskhan out. Kangaskhan can try to use Counter on Body Slam, but this is somewhat predictable. Exeggutor can stomach most attacks from Kangaskhan and 2HKO with Psychic in return. Finally, Starmie is faster than Kangaskhan, can paralyze it, and 2HKOes with its special move of choice.
Moveset: Wallbreaker
Description: Set Description
Body Slam is Kangaskhan's main STAB move, spreading paralysis and ensuring that nothing can switch in for free. A STAB Hyper Beam from Kangaskhan should never be underestimated, KOing most Pokemon from around 65%, including Chansey and Jolteon. Plus, it can KO Alakazam if it's taken minimal chip damage. Earthquake 2HKOes Gengar and Jolteon, but it also helps with scouting for Counter users like Chansey and Snorlax. Surf prevents Rhydon from walling Kangaskhan, 2HKOing it. It should be noted that Kangaskhan takes middling damage from Rhydon's Body Slam and can't be paralyzed by it, making it a very valuable point of entry.
Despite Kangaskhan's "second Tauros" title, it should not be forgotten that it is both a mid-game utility attacker—think Snorlax—and a capable revenge killer, particularly against paralyzed teams. Once Kangaskhan has safely entered the field, it's challenging to switch into due to its coverage and the threat of paralysis from Body Slam, so scouting with the latter should be its main aim. Kangaskhan is very capable of scouting for Counter users thanks to its coverage, so it's good to be patient and settle for Earthquake against Pokemon that carry it, such as Chansey. Remember that Kangaskhan is extremely specially frail, so it should ideally only fight special attackers if they are paralyzed. Even then, it will rely heavily on being eased in through double switches, sleeping Pokemon, and Explosions.

Overview: Kingler is the strongest Pokemon with access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, possessing a dizzying base 130 Attack. This gives Kingler cataclysmic wallbreaking potential, outright OHKOing Chansey given the chance. It also has exclusive access to Crabhammer, which will nearly always land a critical hit, largely making up for its mediocre Special. Kingler isn't exactly slow relative to RBY OU either, being just above Cloyster and Victreebel. This means it isn't completely reliant on paralysis support and is very capable of mowing down teams without it. Overall, while an uncommon threat, Kingler is very capable of running over weakened teams if given a mere turn to set up. Even if it doesn't get a full sweep, the holes Kingler can tear in a team can be more than enough for its teammates to finish the job.
So why isn't Kingler often seen on the big stage, fighting tooth and nail with Kanto's finest? Kingler's sweeping prospects are swiftly put down by paralysis, and this weakness often forces it out, causing it to forfeit any Swords Dance boosts it may have gained beforehand. Kingler's special bulk is also a pressing issue, with even neutral hits like Alakazam's Psychic 2HKOing it. Furthermore, its weakness to Electric-type attacks makes Pokemon like Starmie a royal pain, often causing it to be KOed even at around 75%. These factors make it deceptively difficult to find an opening for Kingler to sweep, and it therefore requires an experienced player to be successful.
Comments: Other Options
Generally, Kingler should never drop any move other than Body Slam, and even this is very difficult to justify. Stomp is a potential choice, allowing Kingler to take a paraflinch approach, but it mandates far more team support to work, which teams can't always afford.
Checks and Counters
Gengar: While Kingler can deal sizable chip to Gengar with Crabhammer to prevent it from repeatedly switching in, Gengar KOes Kingler with Thunderbolt if it has taken any amount of damage. Furthermore, Gengar has ample opportunity to switch in on Kingler's Normal-type attacks and force sleep on the player's team, as it's immune to them.
Electric-types: Zapdos can switch into Hyper Beam or Crabhammer and subsequently OHKO Kingler with Thunderbolt; for Kingler to win, Zapdos has to have been chipped and paralyzed prior, and even then, it requires a +2 Hyper Beam. Much of the same applies to Jolteon, although it is OHKOed by a +2 Hyper Beam and takes very high damage from Body Slam. Furthermore, if Jolteon is asleep, it is nothing more than setup fodder for Kingler.
Paralysis: Kingler is thoroughly debilitated by paralysis, as it can no longer mow down paralyzed teams and its poor special bulk becomes much more apparent. The threat of paralysis can make setting up with Kingler quite difficult, as it's very possible for Kingler to be paralyzed on the turn that it attempts Swords Dance. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Zapdos can easily switch in and threaten it with their paralysis-inducing moves, forcing Kingler out if it can't KO them first. Paralysis from Body Slam can be a particularly depressing experience for any Kingler player, especially when attempting to wrestle down Pokemon like Snorlax and Tauros, so this warrants consideration in prolonged interactions. Pokemon like Lapras and Victreebel become much better Kingler checks if it's paralyzed, as they can outspeed and KO it with super effective hits without fear of Hyper Beam. Reflect Chansey can also be problematic, as it effectively invalidates Kingler's Swords Dance boost and threatens it with Thunder Wave.
Faster Special Attackers: Kingler is extremely frail specially, which makes many special attackers suitable Kingler checks, especially when attempting to revenge kill it. Switching these Pokemon in on a Swords Dance can put Kingler into a fairly awkward position as well. Alakazam and Starmie can paralyze Kingler while threatening it with 2HKOs from their strong special attacks. In fact, even Tauros and Chansey can adapt with Thunderbolt to 2HKO Kingler. However, few of these Pokemon want to actually be attacked by Kingler themselves; if they are paralyzed and Kingler has set up, with the exception of Tauros and sometimes Starmie, these Pokemon can be OHKOed by +2 Hyper Beam.
Physically Bulky Foes: While a +2 Hyper Beam from Kingler is strong, there are Pokemon that can handle it surprisingly well while paralyzing it in return. Slowbro can switch in and paralyze Kingler and doesn't mind stomaching a +2 Hyper Beam if it means stopping a sweep. However, a +2 Body Slam followed up by Hyper Beam has good odds to KO Slowbro. Lapras can easily take a Hyper Beam from Kingler while threatening with Thunderbolt afterward. Exeggutor can also take most hits Kingler can throw at it and threaten with status or a 2HKO from Psychic, though it can take massive damage in the process—or even get KOed if it has taken prior damage—if Kingler has boosted with Swords Dance. Finally, if push comes to shove, Cloyster can switch in and use Explosion, though it can't do anything else lest it become setup fodder.
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Set Description
Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to boost its Attack and wreak havoc. Using it also allows Kingler to reapply a foe's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Kingler has been paralyzed itself. +2 Hyper Beam can OHKO Chansey, Jynx, Jolteon, and Alakazam. It can also OHKO Starmie and Victreebel 30.8% and 56.4% of the time, respectively. The rest of the tier isn't far behind, with foes often crumbling if even a third of their HP has been chipped off. Body Slam lets Kingler deny switch-ins by the threat of paralysis, allowing it to be more self-sufficient rather than mandating team support; if a Pokemon is paralyzed on the switch after Kingler has boosted, a +2 Hyper Beam will likely follow for the KO. Crabhammer allows Kingler to OHKO Rhydon and 3HKO Gengar, the latter of which is immune to Kingler's other attacks, making Crabhammer valuable to prevent it from repeatedly switching in. It also allows Kingler to 3HKO Snorlax 87.2% of the time, allowing it to muscle past Reflect sets. It should be noted that Crabhammer isn't just some better Slash, though; it has some very unfortunate accuracy issues, and a single miss will most likely be Kingler's undoing.
Kingler should be kept until late-game when the opposing team has been weakened or riddled with paralysis. This gives it the best chance of setting up successfully and serving as a wincon. If an entire team has been paralyzed, Kingler will happily take a hit if it means blowing the opposition away. Finding an opportunity to set up can be difficult, though; the best way is to punish a Pokemon using Rest, such as Snorlax or Jolteon. However, simply exploiting weakened, paralyzed Pokemon also gives a worthy payoff. Kingler should ideally be paired with an Electric-type like Zapdos or Jolteon, as they can beat Kingler's primary counters in opposing Electric-types, Starmie, and Slowbro. More offensively, an Electric-type is also a perfect way to lure Rhydon in for Kingler to either set up on or cleave through, which can instantly mean a win with its Electric-type ally in the back.

Format: NU
Overview: Swords Dance Kingler is the strongest wallbreaker and a potent sweeper in RBY NU. At +2, Hyper Beam can OHKO much of the tier, including threats like Mr. Mime, Raticate, and Venomoth, and nearly KO anything except Rock-types. Additionally, Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam will KO any Normal-neutral foe at +2. Rock-types are washed away by Crabhammer, a powerful STAB move that will almost always score a critical hit. It easily OHKOes Golem and 2HKOes Kabutops, coming just short of OHKOing Charizard and Ninetales. Kingler also has decent physical bulk, avoiding 2HKOs from some strong physical attacks such as Golem's Earthquake and opposing +2 Kingler's Body Slam. Due to its power and bulk, Kingler often forces switches and can fish for paralysis with Body Slam as opponents react to a potential Swords Dance sweep.
However, Kingler is very slow for RBY NU, outsped by a myriad of prominent offensive threats. This means it requires extensive paralysis support from teammates to safely sweep and is ruined by getting paralyzed itself; this threat is compounded by Crabhammer's and Hyper Beam's middling accuracy. Also, even neutral special attacks such as Mr. Mime's Psychic 2HKO it. Kingler's weakness to Electric means it is forced out by Thunderbolt users such as Mr. Mime, Clefable, Nidoking, and Electrode, and even Fire Blast is a major threat to it.
Comments: Other Options
Kingler should generally not run any other moves than the four listed in the set. Stomp is much weaker than Body Slam and makes Kingler even more reliant on its team to spread paralysis. Blizzard only hits the relatively niche Exeggcute effectively, 2HKOing it but giving up far more relevant moves. Similarly, Surf's accuracy may sound appealing, as it still OHKOes Golem, but this makes Kingler unable to stop Fire-types and Kabutops. Substitute is held back by Kingler's bad Special, and does not address Kingler's weakness to Thunder Wave.
Checks and Counters
Electric-type Attacks: Electrode, Nidoking, and Mr. Mime outspeed Kingler and can 2HKO it with Thunderbolt, with Electrode even having a chance to OHKO bolstered by its high critical hit rate. Clefable is slower than Kingler and takes heavy damage from boosted Body Slam, but it can paralyze and 2HKO Kingler and does not fear Body Slam paralysis.
Paralysis: Thunder Wave users such as Clefable and Mr. Mime can dash any chance of Kingler sweeping late-game. Getting paralyzed means Kingler can no longer outspeed some of the slowest Pokemon in RBY NU or outspeed faster paralyzed foes.
Faster Special Attackers: Kingler's poor Special means even moderately strong special attacks like Mr. Mime's Psychic 2HKO it. Even Moltres's Fire Blast, which Kingler resists, will always 3HKO it. Its low Speed exacerbates this issue, as it can't outspeed most of the threats that threaten to KO it.
Burn: Kingler, as a Water-type, may eventually need to switch into Fire Blast, which has a 30.1% chance to burn. A burned Kingler must use Swords Dance to negate the Attack drop but can at least use Crabhammer unhindered.
Moveset: The Cringe Crab (Swords Dance)
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Swords Dance defines Kingler's sweep and can reapply paralysis Speed reduction in situations where it needs to set up on a Thunder Wave or Body Slam user. Body Slam is a very powerful attack after a boost and threatens switch-ins with paralysis, which helps Kingler sweep and support its team. Hyper Beam is an outstanding finishing move, dealing massive damage to almost anything and outright OHKOing frailer foes at +2. Crabhammer hits Rock-types, complementing Kingler's physical damage output, and removes Fire-types after mild chip or Body Slam.
Kingler's low Speed means it highly appreciates paralysis support from teammates such as Mr. Mime and Clefable. Kingler also appreciates teammates that can switch into Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt, such as Golem and Nidoking. Early-game, Kingler can wallbreak with Crabhammer and spread paralysis with Body Slam. It appreciates opportunities to enter the field against Charizard, Golem, and Blastoise, preferably as a revenge killer rather than switching into attacks, then using Body Slam, Crabhammer, or Swords Dance to remove one or two major threats, paving the way for its allies to sweep. If Kingler is saved for late-game, when the opponent's team is weakened and paralyzed, and sent in to revenge kill a foe lacking paralysis, it can easily use Swords Dance to sweep. Whether wallbreaking or sweeping, Kingler will want to stay and fight until it drops unless it has a safe switch and is still healthy. Kingler users should note the state of the opponent's team and whether significant checks like Mr. Mime remain healthy to decide whether to set up or use its raw power.

Format: Stadium OU
Overview: With a cataclysmic Attack stat that can be boosted by Swords Dance, Kingler can function as a serviceable late-game sweeper that bullies paralyzed Pokemon. With the exclusive STAB Crabhammer, its mediocre Special is largely made up for and gives it unresisted coverage, meaning Kingler is capable of dealing with common obstacles to its sweep such as Rhydon and Gengar. Furthermore, Kingler's Speed is just high enough to pose an offensive threat, being faster than defensive presences like Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax. Thus, stopping Kingler from steamrolling or breaking holes in a team can be quite difficult if the stage is set.
However, Kingler is only barely viable in Stadium OU. Hyper Beam is massively nerfed in Stadium, so its offensive capabilities are noticeably worse. Furthermore, its low Special and middling Speed mean that any strong special attacker like Alakazam or Starmie can 2HKO and revenge kill it with ease; this also makes it very difficult to switch in. A somewhat related weakness is that Kingler's frailty and Speed reliance mean it cannot afford to be paralyzed at all. Its weakness to the abundant Thunderbolt only worsens this; many users can outright OHKO it. Kingler is monumentally reliant on paralysis support, which is very hard to provide. Due to these factors, finding opportunities for Kingler to succeed is very difficult; ergo, it is generally not recommended on conventional teams.
Comments: 
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Swords Dance is Kingler's claim to fame, allowing it to deal massive damage to virtually any Pokemon in the tier; note that it cannot boost past +4. +2 Body Slam deals just enough damage to prevent Alakazam, Starmie, and even Chansey from using their recovery moves to stall it out; thus, they cannot switch in lest they get severely punished. Crabhammer backs this up with unresisted coverage, preventing Gengar from repeatedly switching in and threatening a 3HKO. It also OHKOes Rhydon and is Kingler's best option against Tauros even at +2; it also has a high chance to 3HKO Snorlax, meaning Reflect variants can't consistently Rest stall it. Kingler's final moveslot defines its role. Double-Edge acts as a potent finishing tool, as recoil is not sustained when it KOes in Stadium, including breaking Substitutes. Thus, Double-Edge makes Kingler more of a wallbreaker that can pressure Substitute users like Chansey. +2 Double-Edge also has a chance to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Exeggutor, which makes it a good opportunity to punish Rest. Alternatively, Substitute can be used to give Kingler safety against status and exploit resting Pokemon like Snorlax and Exeggutor.
Kingler has a terrible movepool, but there is room for customization; usually, the fourth moveslot is the most replaceable. Stomp is the most compelling, letting Kingler fish for flinches on paralyzed Pokemon while using its strong Attack stat. Hyper Beam is technically usable at +2 for OHKOs on Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, and sometimes Starmie, but its forced recharge turn can completely ruin any chance of sweeping, defeating the purpose of using it.
Kingler should be used on teams that can provide ample paralysis support, which can be a bit difficult given status protection being available in Stadium. Ideally, partners like Alakazam, Exeggutor, Jolteon, and Starmie should be used to consistently get uncontested paralysis. Jolteon is of particular note for luring in Rhydon very consistently while resisting Electric-type hits itself, thus giving it a decent Zapdos matchup. Special sponges like the ubiquitous Chansey make up for Kingler's terrible weakness to special attacks; Chansey also has access to Thunder Wave. Kingler should ideally be used when an opposing Pokemon is at its most vulnerable; paralyzed Pokemon using Recover, resting Pokemon, and those using Substitute are ample opportunities to bring it in. Generally, most of the opposing team should be paralyzed for it to be successful.

Overview: Lapras's STAB Blizzard and tremendous bulk give it positive matchups against many of the physical attackers of Ubers, namely Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax. Its Speed is just enough to outrun Chansey and Exeggutor, which it can potentially threaten with Sing, disrupting common sleep strategies. Because Lapras is so hard to wall as a result of BoltBeam coverage, absorbing its Sing with paralyzed Pokemon is also very difficult; it can blow past Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie easily when they're paralyzed. Furthermore, Lapras is generally not concerned with taking paralysis itself, and when it's paralyzed it can potentially switch in on sleep moves from Pokemon like Exeggutor and threaten massive damage thereafter. Lapras's quadruple resistance to Ice and immunity to freeze lets it switch into certain Ice-type moves, notably against Chansey, softening a somewhat common Mewtwo removal strategy. Lapras's ability to trade hits favorably against almost the entirety of Kanto's finest allows it to clear the way for even stronger allies, positioning them for a quick beatdown.
However, Lapras's lack of reliability comes back to bite it very frequently. It's easily worn down over the course of a game, as its Speed often forces it to take a hit before it can make a move, and it crucially lacks reliable recovery. Being weak to Thunderbolt and neutral to Psychic doesn't help it either, and an untimely critical hit can significantly limit the impact it will have over the course of a game. Additionally, Lapras faces stiff Water-type competition in Cloyster and Starmie. Both are faster than Lapras, and Cloyster has access to Clamp and Explosion, while Starmie has Recover and Thunder Wave. While they can't replicate its power or Sing access, they usually bring more consistent utility to a team, which often pushes Lapras out during teambuilding.
Comments: Other Options
Lapras has a massive movepool that's worth delving into; however, Blizzard and Thunderbolt are generally undroppable. Hyper Beam can be used on Lapras's Confuse Ray set over Body Slam, providing a better matchup against Jynx by allowing a KO with two Thunderbolts followed by Hyper Beam. Lapras has access to Psychic, which can trigger a Special drop overflow against a +5 Mewtwo with maximum investment, but it has little use outside of this. Ice Beam can be used for the additional PP and accuracy, but the drop in power noticeable—for example, Ice Beam fails to reliably 2HKO Exeggutor or come close to 2HKOing Tauros. Since Lapras wants to win a single notable KO through sheer bulk and power, it tends to be counterproductive.
Lapras can attempt to use a Rest set that allows it to try to repeatedly win trades, but this cedes momentum to Mewtwo and Thunderbolt users like Zapdos. This can be used alongside Reflect to make Lapras a pain for Swords Dance Mew, Tauros, and Snorlax to deal with, but this is performed more effectively by Pokemon like Zapdos and Aerodactyl. This set also ends up making it extremely weak against Mewtwo, which pressures it effortlessly with nuclear special attacks and the ability to set up while Lapras is asleep.
Checks and Counters
Electric-types: While Lapras deals massive damage to Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode, notably 2HKOing the former due to its Blizzard weakness, Lapras will quickly get forced out if it can't KO them outright. They deal massive damage with STAB Thunderbolt, with Jolteon and Zapdos 2HKOing it and Electrode doing so after mild chip damage. Additionally, their high critical hit rates can turn a 2HKO into an OHKO. Lapras should only attempt to win if they are paralyzed and the team lacks adequate switch-ins.
Mewtwo: Mewtwo frequently uses Thunderbolt, and while this can't 2HKO Lapras unboosted, Mewtwo will frequently be at +2 or higher. Lapras struggles to damage Mewtwo at all, with an unboosted Mewtwo only taking around a quarter from Blizzard. The maximum damage Lapras can deal to it is 29.8% with Hyper Beam. The best shot Lapras has of winning is via parafusion tactics.
Chansey: While Lapras can use Hyper Beam to KO Chansey from a range of 37.9% to 44.6% and has the potential to freeze it or put it to sleep, Chansey has numerous ways to beat Lapras. A paralyzed Chansey is generally not afraid of non-Confuse Ray Lapras, stonewalling it, and Sing variants can fire off uncontested sleep with little Lapras can do. Light Screen variants designed to beat Mewtwo can also nullify Lapras's main strength, its powerful STAB Blizzard. Chansey can also threaten Lapras with a 3HKO from Thunderbolt. Sing Lapras teams should not paralyze Chansey and instead aim to use Lapras's faster Sing to force sleep onto the opposing team. This can be done through switching in on a predicted Seismic Toss or Ice Beam, both of which Lapras shrugs off.
Amnesia Snorlax: The minute Snorlax scores an Amnesia boost, Lapras is incapable of making any meaningful progress against it outside of a lucky freeze or critical hit. Because Snorlax takes a chunk from Blizzard switching in or trying to set up on Lapras, it's not the worst matchup, but it can quickly become unwinnable if Snorlax gets a free chance to set up.
Mew: While uncommon, Rock Slide Mew is a terrible matchup for Lapras, 2HKOing it at +2. Niche Mew variants may also use Thunderbolt to possibly 3HKO it. However, other sets are terrified of sustained assaults from Lapras, especially when paralyzed, as Lapras's Blizzard has a favorable chance to 3HKO Mew. Confuse Ray Lapras variants are very annoying for Swords Dance Mew to deal with, as confusion damage increases due to its Attack boosts. Confusion damage uses the opponent's Reflect in damage calculation, so if Mew has Reflect active, confusion damage will ignore it.
Alakazam and Starmie: While rarer in the Ubers landscape, these Pokemon can paralyze and trade blows with Lapras easily if not paralyzed themselves, mostly thanks to their access to Recover. Alakazam can 3HKO Lapras with Psychic if it lands a single Special drop or critical hit, which is likely in a prolonged interaction. Starmie is a particularly poor matchup, possessing Thunderbolt to potentially 3HKO Lapras.
Gengar: Gengar 3HKOes Lapras with Thunderbolt while only being 3HKOed by Blizzard, and it can switch into Lapras's Thunderbolt or Normal-type coverage and still win one-on-one. It also possesses a more accurate sleep-inducing move in Hypnosis.
Sleep Leads: When faced with a faster sleep lead, such as Gengar, Jynx, or Hypno, Sing Lapras tends to be nothing more than a free opportunity for the opponent to try to land sleep or KO Lapras, which is dissuaded from switching out and letting a teammate be put to sleep.
Moveset: Confuse Ray
Description: Set Description
Lapras's STAB Blizzard is no joke, OHKOing Dragonite and almost always OHKOing Rhydon and Golem. It also 2HKOes notable Pokemon like Zapdos, Exeggutor, Persian, and sometimes even Tauros. Tauros is a notable matchup, as few Pokemon are capable of beating it in a head-on fight; not only can Lapras potentially 2HKO it, but it can also survive two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. Thunderbolt ensures Water-types like Cloyster, Starmie, and Slowbro can't wall Lapras, as it 2HKOes Cloyster and 3HKOes the others. Body Slam allows Lapras to be more self-sufficient in spreading paralysis, which also supports parafusion with Confuse Ray. It also gives Lapras an effective move against Jynx, rarely 3HKOing it.
Thanks to RBY's brutal confusion mechanics, when supported with paralysis, Lapras can position itself into a positive matchup against most Swords Dance Mew variants, including Reflect sets. A single +2 self-hit puts Mew into Blizzard 2HKO range, and from there, Lapras tends to win the interaction. Another application consists of disrupting paralyzed Mewtwo and Slowbro's Amnesia setup, but outside of this, it's generally quite weak.
Confuse Ray Lapras works best as a mid-game threat that disrupts conventional offensive strategies. Progress-makers like Snorlax and Mew tend to have trouble combatting Lapras, as they cannot KO it quickly. However, this only works consistently from full HP: thus, Lapras should be kept for one single, favorable trade before going on its rampage. Lapras benefits from an allied Mew with Thunder Wave, which is one of the most consistent methods of landing paralysis against a myriad of threats, most notably including opposing Mew. Other paralysis support options include Alakazam, Chansey, Jolteon, Zapdos, Dragonite, and Slowbro. Lapras teams tend to struggle against Zapdos, so Jolteon is a suitable partner, though Rhydon is also suitable for a more definitive answer.

Moveset: Sing Lead
Description: Set Description
Thanks to the presence of Exeggutor and Tauros in the lead slot, Lapras is capable of being a decent lead itself. It possesses the ability to outspeed and 2HKO Exeggutor with its STAB Blizzard or land Sing before getting put to sleep itself. Against Tauros, it is able to stomach two Body Slams and a Hyper Beam and is virtually never KOed without a critical hit. In return, it can attempt to put Tauros to sleep or fire off Blizzard, which will 2HKO a little over a quarter of the time. Lapras can use its excellent coverage and bulk to use Thunderbolt against Starmie and unboosted Slowbro mid-game. It also completely stonewalls Cloyster, forcing it to use Explosion or switch out in fear of being 2HKOed by said Thunderbolt. Blizzard's 10.2% freeze chance also means Lapras can potentially flip a game on its head by securing a freeze on the likes of Chansey or Mewtwo. Hyper Beam is used in the last slot as a decent finishing tool against Chansey, KOing from about 40%.
While Lapras does have many qualities that make it enticing as a lead, it also suffers from some bad matchups. Jynx, Gengar, Jolteon, and Zapdos all are common leads that make the Lapras user start off on a terrible foot. Zapdos and Jolteon are massively threatening with STAB Thunderbolt, which 2HKOes Lapras, and they have a good chance to OHKO outright thanks to their high critical hit rates. While Zapdos is 2HKOed by Blizzard, this is still a very favorable matchup for it. Jynx and Gengar both outspeed and carry their own more accurate sleep-inducing moves, threatening to put Lapras to sleep before it can do anything. Lapras also suffers from its lack of recovery, often being worn down very quickly while taking stray hits from Snorlax and Mew. This makes it quite difficult to facilitate Lapras, especially when common Pokemon like Chansey and Thunderbolt Mewtwo can switch in repeatedly and shrug off the damage with their reliable recovery, only fearing being frozen.
Lapras and its traits make it somewhat matchup dependent, as it can be quite devastating against teams that rely on Exeggutor for sleep or Cloyster for their Snorlax check. It is best to maximize your gain early on, putting something to sleep and using Blizzard to aim for a freeze. If these goals are achieved, then sacrificing Lapras to the likes of Sing Chansey is often optimal. One additional benefit is the lack of Thunderbolt on Chansey in Ubers, meaning it is typically safe to stay in and fish for a freeze while Chansey tries to put it to sleep. Additionally, if threats such as Cloyster are revealed, Lapras should be kept healthy to repeatedly switch in and freely use Blizzard into incoming Chansey and Mewtwo.

Format: OU
Overview: Lapras is a potent special attacker backed up by solid bulk and a good variety of coverage and utility moves, such as access to Blizzard and Sing. While it faces strong competition from other Pokemon with similar coverage, such as Starmie, its combination of power and bulk, as well as access to Sing, gives Lapras a unique set of qualities that give it an important niche in the metagame. Access to STAB Blizzard, as well as Thunderbolt, enables it to hit almost every Pokemon in the game for at least neutral damage, making it quite difficult to switch into. Its Speed is just enough to get by Chansey as well, allowing it to potentially put it to sleep one-on-one. It also has positive matchups against Tauros and Snorlax, two of the strongest Pokemon in the metagame, which can be crucial in many instances.
However, Lapras is bogged down by some flaws. Lapras's typing leaves it with a weakness to Thunderbolt and neutrality to Psychic, which often makes it easy to wear down with Pokemon like Starmie and Alakazam running around. It also struggles mightily against Chansey if it can't put it to sleep, which stonewalls it with its incredible bulk. Regardless, Lapras holds a niche in RBY OU, and it sees success on quite a few teams.
Comments: Other Options
Ice Beam is an alternative STAB option to use in place of Blizzard, but the lack of power is really noticeable and generally not worth the extra accuracy and PP. Rest and Reflect can be used in conjunction to give Lapras much appreciated survivability to answer threats such as Tauros more reliably throughout the game, but the set is easy to pressure via powerful special attacks, particularly Psychic- or Electric-type ones, and the lack of offensive pressure makes it a risky and generally undesirable pick.
Checks and Counters
Chansey: Lapras struggles immensely in attempting to break through Chansey. It can easily Soft-Boiled away any damage taken and force Lapras out with the threat of Thunder Wave. Lapras may attempt to put it to sleep with Sing, but the move is inaccurate, somewhat predictable, and completely useless against a paralyzed Chansey.
Zapdos and Jolteon: While Lapras's Blizzard respectively 2HKOes and 3HKOes these Pokemon, team structures that include Lapras generally leave themselves very vulnerable to Electric-type attacks, which Zapdos and Jolteon can easily exploit and punish with powerful Thunderbolts. It may even be preferable to sacrifice Lapras in a one-on-one scenario just to get some chip damage on Zapdos in particular, but the same cannot be said for Jolteon, which should nearly always have the upper hand against Lapras and only fears a potential Body Slam paralysis.
Starmie and Alakazam: If they are not paralyzed, these two Pokemon can tank any hit Lapras throws at them and Recover off the damage easily while threatening it with Thunder Wave. All Lapras needs to turn the tides on them is paralysis and some correct predictions.
Amnesia Snorlax: Although it takes a while to get going and has to worry about Sing, Snorlax doesn't take much damage from any of Lapras's attacks after one or two Amnesia boosts and can retaliate with Body Slam. Although it is unlikely Amnesia Snorlax would be used as a switch-in, it dominates one-on-one.
Moveset: Standard
Description: Blizzard is Lapras's most powerful attack, allowing it to deal heavy damage to anything that doesn't possess either huge special bulk or a resistance to Ice. Thunderbolt allows Lapras to hit Water-types, giving it the ability to muscle through paralyzed Starmie, which would otherwise be a poor matchup. In the third slot, Hyper Beam is Lapras's best bet to finish off Pokemon with a high Special but low Defense, such as Chansey and Alakazam, which are otherwise good answers to Lapras; however, Body Slam may be preferred, as it gives Lapras the ability to somewhat reliably paralyze opposing Starmie. The last slot is usually Sing, a move that provides great utility and scares off Pokemon that would otherwise function as great Lapras answers, with Chansey usually being the main target. Its low accuracy can be unfortunate, as Lapras doesn't have easy ways to shrug off any status or damage that may come its way, so misses can be particularly devastating. If the sleep move is not necessary, you may opt to run Confuse Ray instead, which is Lapras's best shot at powering through paralyzed special walls.
When using Lapras, you should first figure out a plan to take care of Chansey, as it can shrug off Blizzard quite easily. Snorlax's Self-Destruct and Exeggutor's Explosion are usually the best ways to achieve this, as your opponent should be able to preserve their Chansey quite easily by simply switching out if you try to defeat it via repeated Ice Beams, PP stalling, or strong physical attacks. However, it is still possible for Lapras to pressure Chansey via Sing, so if you cannot find an opportunity to threaten it via Explosion, you can still rely on Sing to get the job done. Non-paralyzed Starmie and Alakazam are both answers to Lapras as well, threatening to shut it down with Thunder Wave, as they are simply able to use Recover until Lapras is fully paralyzed. If running Body Slam, you should attempt to predict their entrance and hit them with it; should you manage to paralyze them, Lapras will outspeed them and be much harder to stop. Lapras has great potential to create significant advantages between access to Sing and strong matchups against very popular Pokemon such as Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon, but its checks must be taken care of before it can have any impact on the game.

Overview: Lickitung has many desirable traits among OU Swords Dance users that make it stand out from the crowd. These include STAB Body Slam, Hyper Beam, and Wrap, all the physical and special coverage it could ever want, and bulk roughly on par with Tauros. Unfortunately, its wide movepool and STAB Hyper Beam are let down by its abysmal base 55 Attack, making its STAB moves no more powerful than any other Swords Dance user's non-STAB attacks, and its awful base 30 Speed ties it for the slowest fully evolved Pokemon in the entire game. Lickitung is very easy to play around once paralyzed, making it extremely risky to stay in on anything that can paralyze it.
Nearly every unique trait Lickitung has is eclipsed by another Pokemon. Its role as a Swords Dance user with Wrap is taken by Victreebel, its Water-type coverage is done better by Kabutops and Kingler, and its ability to hit Gengar with Earthquake is outclassed by Sandslash's STAB Earthquake. Its only redeeming traits are its STAB Hyper Beam and that, unlike other Swords Dance users, it has no blatant defensive weaknesses thanks to its decent bulk and strong Normal typing, which has no common weaknesses and allows it to avoid Body Slam paralysis. Although Lickitung has many positive traits as an OU Swords Dance user, its positives are heavily outweighed by its negatives, making it extremely impractical and difficult to use.
Comments: 
Moveset: Swords Dance Sweeper
Description: Set Description
STAB Hyper Beam, Wrap, and Lickitung's good defensive qualities are the only reasons to consider it over better Swords Dance users, such as Kingler or Sandslash. +6 Hyper Beam reaches such immense power that it even OHKOes Cloyster 82.1% of the time, though +4 Hyper Beam still packs enough power to almost always OHKO threats with more moderate bulk, such as Zapdos and Tauros. Earthquake is essential coverage, as it is Lickitung's only option to hit Gengar for super effective damage, and it deals decent damage to Rock types at +2; +2 Earthquake has a 7.7% chance to OHKO Gengar and a 6.6% chance to 2HKO Rhydon. Wrap is a useful utility move that can be used to pivot out of bad matchups and chip paralyzed foes into Hyper Beam range while keeping Lickitung safe from paralysis. Water-type coverage can be considered; Bubble Beam 2HKOes Rhydon and Golem and has a 33% chance to drop their Speed, which allows Lickitung to outspeed and KO them on the next turn, whereas Surf deals enough damage to prevent Rhydon from using Substitute later. Body Slam is Lickitung's best option for dealing consistent damage, 2HKOing Chansey and having a 95.5% chance to 3HKO Snorlax at +2.
Lickitung's only way to find success is by putting it on a team with heavy paralysis support and statusing nearly the entire enemy team before bringing it out. The best opportunity it has to set up is to switch in when a paralyzed Snorlax uses Rest and boost to +2 while Snorlax switches out. It can then try to choke the paralyzed enemy team with boosted Wrap and Hyper Beam.

Overview: In the first generation of Pokemon, Normal-types aren't to be taken lightly thanks to powerful STAB moves such as Body Slam, Double-Edge, and the infamous Hyper Beam. Even all the way down in RBY PU, Lickitung exists to prove that not all Normal-types are created equal, falling far short of Fearow and Porygon. Lickitung initially looks promising with its access to STAB Hyper Beam and Swords Dance, amazing coverage options, and potential to spread paralysis with Body Slam. However, it falls short everywhere else due to its absolutely horrendous stats. Its atrocious Speed makes it slower than almost every relevant Pokemon, and is 3HKOed or 4HKOed by the majority of the tier. Lickitung can theoretically win one-on-one against physically frail Pokemon like Staryu and Gastly, but the damage taken in return leaves Lickitung easily revenge killed. Furthermore, Lickitung is almost entirely outclassed by Pinsir, which boasts much higher Attack, Defense, and Speed; in fact, Pinsir's Normal-type attacks hit harder than Lickitung's. Lickitung's only niche is its ability to sweep with Swords Dance, which is something Pinsir can do better. For these reasons, Lickitung remains a terrible Pokemon in RBY PU, and it shouldn't be used unless you're looking to torture yourself.
Comments: 
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: After a Swords Dance, Lickitung is able to OHKO or 2HKO the entire tier with the combination of Body Slam, Earthquake, and Hyper Beam. Body Slam is Lickitung's safest move; it deals decent damage to neutral targets, and paralysis helps mitigate Lickitung's horrendous Speed. Earthquake is its best option against Omanyte and Gastly, which would otherwise wall it, and the plethora of Fire- and Poison-types in the tier, all of which it OHKOes or 2HKOes at +2. Hyper Beam is Lickitung's most powerful move, and does 60% at minimum to every neutral target in the tier after a Swords Dance. If you must use Lickitung, it is absolutely imperative that its teammates spread paralysis as much as possible before revealing it. Teammates such as Porygon, Staryu, and Dragonair can be very useful as they can spread status without much trouble.

Overview: Machamp is a decent blanket check and progress maker in RBY PU due to its decent bulk, base 130 Attack, and decent coverage. It can switch into Nidoqueen, Graveler, and Omanyte and threaten them out with super effective damage, while they threaten Machamp much less in return. Notably, Machamp reliably 2HKOes Nidoqueen with Earthquake while avoiding a 3HKO in return. Although Graveler and Omanyte threaten a 3HKO on Machamp, both are slower and 2HKOed by Earthquake. Machamp's bulk allows it to go toe-to-toe with Pokemon such as Staryu and Porygon, and Machamp can also stop late-game cleaners like Seaking and Scyther with its impressive bulk and Body Slam paralysis chance. Once on the field, Machamp is difficult to force out, as its checks, barring Fearow, cannot switch in safely. While Machamp is outpaced by much of the metagame, its base 55 Speed still gets the job done against noteworthy Pokemon such as Drowzee, Graveler, and Porygon.
However, Machamp's Speed is its defining flaw. If given free entry, fast attackers like Fearow can easily force out Machamp with Drill Peck, and if Machamp is at low health, Pokemon like Gastly, Rapidash, Nidoqueen, and Staryu can KO it. While Machamp can switch into a lot of the metagame with its bulk, it can only afford to do so once per game since it gets worn down easily. Even small amounts of chip damage render Machamp incapable of switching into threats, so Machamp tends to get sacrificed for momentum after its first entrance. Similarly, while Machamp's typing means some foes, like Nidoqueen and Arcanine, cannot touch it for super effective damage, its Fighting typing gives it few relevant resistances while giving it a crippling weakness to Drill Peck and Psychic. Machamp's low Speed and role as a switch-in also means that it is often on the receiving end of a burn from Fire Blast or a critical hit from faster foes. Machamp's coverage, while decent, is somewhat prediction-reliant. Earthquake, Rock Slide, Body Slam, and Submission all give free entry to much of the metagame, allowing the opponent to dance around Machamp's coverage and maneuver in something with a better matchup. Pokemon like Gastly and Nidoqueen are only threatened by Machamp's Earthquake, which Fearow can take advantage of. Fearow greatly affects how Machamp is played, as Fearow gaining entry is disastrous due to its one-sided matchup on Machamp. Once Fearow is on the field, the Machamp player is often forced to sacrifice a Pokemon due to Fearow's immense offensive presence. Otherwise-decent moves like Body Slam and Earthquake become risky to use due to the threat of Fearow switching in.
Comments: Other Options
Low Kick is an option to 2HKO Porygon and Omanyte while carrying a 30% chance to flinch. However, Low Kick is still inaccurate and its Base Power is so low that in many situations it is better to use Body Slam for more power. Low Kick also does not deal enough damage to allow Machamp to KO Fearow with Hyper Beam afterward. Fire Blast is another option, but since its main targets, Pinsir and Vileplume, are uncommon, it is not worth using. Fire Blast can also fish for a burn on Fearow, but in most situations it is better to do as much damage as possible with Hyper Beam or Rock Slide.
Checks and Counters
Fearow: Fearow is by far the biggest reason not to use Machamp. Fearow is so offensively potent that giving it free entry often guarantees losing a Pokemon. Fearow takes little from Body Slam, is immune to Body Slam paralysis, and is immune to Earthquake, while Fearow's Drill Peck is a likely 2HKO on Machamp. Fearow also has a high critical hit rate, meaning it is not rare to see it OHKO Machamp with Drill Peck. For the Machamp user to defeat a Fearow, Machamp needs to hit Fearow with Submission or Rock Slide as it switches in, avoid being OHKOed by a critical hit Drill Peck, and then land a Hyper Beam or Rock Slide. This is a favorable trade for Machamp, but a single miss or critical hit can flip this interaction on its head, and Machamp loses much of its defensive value after taking one Drill Peck.
Revenge Killers: Once at low health, there is no shortage of revenge killers that can come in and finish off Machamp, such as Nidoqueen, Arcanine, Gastly, and Fearow. If Machamp is paralyzed, Drowzee and Graveler can also come in and KO it.
Burns: Despite hitting them super effectively with Earthquake, Machamp must be wary of Rapidash and Arcanine since they have a 30% chance to inflict a burn with Fire Blast, which ruins Machamp.
Sleepers: Machamp cannot 2HKO Vileplume, and Vileplume can safely switch in and use Sleep Powder, even if Machamp is carrying Fire Blast. Gastly can switch into a Submission or Body Slam and use Hypnosis or deal significant damage with Psychic. Drowzee loses one-on-one, but a single Psychic allows Machamp to be easily revenge killed.
Moveset: Bulky Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Earthquake 2HKOes Nidoqueen, Graveler, Rapidash, and Arcanine, and they are incapable of 2HKOing in return. It deals significant enough damage to deter Drowzee and Staryu from switching in. Machamp can OHKO Gastly with Earthquake while surviving even a critical hit Psychic. Body Slam is a midground option that can paralyze Staryu or Seaking. Hyper Beam can finish off foes like Drowzee, Staryu, and Dragonair. Also, Fearow is usually KOed by Hyper Beam after taking a Submission or Rock Slide beforehand. Submission primarily hits Porygon for huge damage and is a decent midground option against Graveler and Omanyte to deny Fearow a free switch-in due to the fear of a subsequent Hyper Beam. However, Submission has a dreadful 80% accuracy, and recoil often puts Machamp in range of a Fearow Drill Peck. Lastly, Rock Slide mainly is used to 2HKO Fearow and OHKO Scyther 25% of the time. However, dropping any of Machamp's moves for Rock Slide is not advised due to how important each of its other moves are.
Machamp is best used as a switch-in to Nidoqueen, Graveler, and Omanyte. All of them are terrified by Earthquake, and the Rock-types can be hit with Submission, which deters Fearow from switching in. Machamp can also come in on Porygon and threaten it for upwards of 78%. Once in, Machamp is best used as a mid-game progress maker by throwing out powerful attacks and leveraging Machmap's impressive bulk. Very little can safely switch into Machamp bar Fearow, which means that Omanyte and Graveler, which can switch into Fearow, are great partners to Machamp. In return, Machamp can switch into Nidoqueen's Earthquake for Omanyte and Graveler. However, it may be worthwhile to sacrifice a Pokemon to give Machamp free entry against Nidoqueen in order to minimize the chances of a critical hit or freeze. Bar switching Rock-types in on Fearow, it is discouraged to switch Machamp out of the field because once weakened, Machamp has a hard time coming back in without sacrificing another Pokemon. Machamp can also switch into Staryu's Thunder Wave or Surf directed at Graveler, since it does not mind paralysis as much as its teammates, as its slow Speed means it doesn't lose too many important matchups once paralyzed; paralysis also insulates Machamp from getting burned. However, a paralyzed Machamp is slower and more afraid of Graveler and Drowzee, as they can usually beat Machamp one-on-one. Paralysis also makes Submission even less likely to hit.

Overview: With STAB Fighting-type haymakers at its disposal, Machamp can look enticing to the average player. Being as fast as Exeggutor ensures it edges out and 2HKOes Chansey with even Low Kick, which many Pokemon simply cannot achieve. Similarly, Machamp has the potential to give Tauros and Snorlax trouble, albeit to a lesser extent due to a deathly fear of paralysis. It's also got some fair physical bulk and a handy resistance to Rock Slide, allowing it to switch into and threaten Rhydon. This boils down to solidifying Machamp as a straightforward attacker that benefits strongly from paralysis support.
Machamp's main problem is that while nearly every team includes the "Big 3" Normal-types — which Machamp can excel against in a flat one-on-one — a Psychic-type usually isn't far behind them. Machamp simply can't deal with Psychic-types, often failing to muster even a 2HKO on most and taking massive damage in return. Ergo, while Machamp hits like a freight train, it offers little defensive utility, which often opens gaping holes in its team. Additionally, Machamp despises paralysis, as what little Speed it has is what ensures it can threaten the Normal-types it wants to go after. When looking for a Pokemon to pummel paralyzed teams, Rhydon is often a better choice, possessing much greater defensive utility, immunity to Thunder Wave, and generally superior STAB moves. Machamp is thus a rare sight in RBY OU and generally isn't recommended.
Comments: 
Moveset: Wallbreaker
Description: STAB Low Kick may seem unassuming, but its 30.1% flinch rate in RBY makes Machamp excellent at bullying paralyzed Pokemon, making up for its mediocre defensive stats. Thanks to this, Machamp can potentially 2HKO a paralyzed Chansey — a very common sight in RBY OU — before it can muster a response. Alternatively, Submission can be used for more power, allowing Machamp to 2HKO Snorlax, Rhydon, and Tauros, albeit at the cost of significant recoil. Body Slam lets Machamp be a little more self-sufficient, paralyzing potential switch-ins to turn the tables on them. Hyper Beam is Machamp's strongest Normal-type attack, allowing it to KO Pokemon that otherwise shrug off its STAB move. Alakazam is a noteworthy target, as it can end up being 2HKOed switching in if it's paralyzed by Body Slam first. Finally, Earthquake ensures Machamp isn't completely helpless against Gengar, 2HKOing it and Jolteon.
Machamp has a wide offensive movepool, allowing it to fine-tune itself to fit a team. Using both Submission and Low Kick can let Machamp 2HKO Tauros, allowing it to more cleanly win a one-on-one interaction. Fire Blast deals up to 34.6% to Exeggutor with a high burn rate that can ruin its Explosion. Counter can be effective with Machamp's stat line, allowing it to switch in on a Hyper Beam and score a guaranteed OHKO on Pokemon like Tauros and Snorlax. This also applies when switching into Snorlax's Body Slam and Chansey's Seismic Toss; both Pokemon will often switch out in response, allowing Machamp to severely damage the switch-in. Since Machamp struggles a bit against Reflect Chansey, Karate Chop can be a serviceable option, being what's effectively a 100-Base Power Normal-type move that ignores Reflect thanks to its near-guaranteed critical hit rate. Unfortunately, Machamp's Speed leaves Karate Chop short of the 99.6% cap, making it a tad inconsistent. Finally, Rock Slide can be used for better matchups against Articuno and Zapdos, but it falls short of 2HKOing the latter, which makes it questionable.

Overview: Machamp is the embodiment of a tank in NU, capable of taking a wide array of attacks while attempting to hit back harder. Machamp's Fighting STAB makes it capable of threatening top-tier Pokemon like Clefable, Golem, and Kabutops, and it has complementary coverage in Rock Slide for Charizard and Venomoth. Machamp also has a powerful Hyper Beam, coming off the highest Attack stat in the tier, even KOing one of the tier's few Fighting-resistant Pokemon, Mr. Mime, after Body Slam. Although Machamp has high Attack and solid bulk, its poor Speed often means it mandates heavy paralysis support, lest it be easily outsped and revenge KOed by several common Pokemon. Machamp's reliance on the inaccurate Submission as a STAB move also can make it inconsistent at its role.
Comments: 
Moveset: All-Out Attacker
Description: Submission makes Machamp the best offensive check to Clefable, easily 2HKOing it along with Golem, Kabutops, and Wigglytuff, and it has high odds to OHKO Raticate. Rock Slide nails common Fighting-resistant foes, 2HKOing Charizard, Moltres, and Venomoth. Earthquake hits Nidoking, which resists both Submission and Rock Slide, and also hits the rare Gastly while generally being a solid, high Base Power neutral attack against a majority of the tier. Body Slam lets Machamp spread paralysis itself and Hyper Beam can be used to trade against a chipped Mr. Mime, but otherwise Machamp's coverage moves are often stronger against the rest of the tier. Substitute allows Machamp to capitalize on the switches it often forces through its offensive presence, especially against paralyzed foes,
Thunder Wave leads like Mr. Mime and Clefable are great partners for Machamp to start a game off with, spreading the yellow magic early. Stun Spore Venomoth and bulky Body Slam users like Blastoise and Charizard also aid Machamp in this regard. Machamp also helps Charizard by switching into—and beating—Rock-types like Golem and Kabutops, while Charizard outspeeds and threatens Fighting-resistant foes like Exeggcute, Mr. Mime, and Venomoth. Machamp's damage output can generate opportunities for faster Pokemon like Electrode and the aforementioned Charizard to clean up late game. Electrode in particular can assist Machamp with Thunder Wave while also appreciating Machamp's positive matchup against Golem and ability to effectively weaken Nidoking with Earthquake.

Format: PU
Overview: Magmar finds a niche in RBY PU thanks to its diverse movepool compared to the tier's other Fire-types. Psychic allows Magmar to hit many top Pokemon without risking Fire Blast's 85% accuracy and makes it the only Fire-type not walled by the rare Omanyte. Magmar's access to Confuse Ray and Smokescreen gives it better matchups against Gastly and Seaking, making it difficult for the former to land Hypnosis reliably and for the latter to set up Agility. It also has Counter, forcing opposing Fire-types to be wary of using a Normal-type attack against it. Despite these upsides, Magmar is still largely outclassed due to its poor stats compared to Arcanine and Rapidash. It should never be used as a replacement for Arcanine, since Arcanine's access to Agility, greater bulk, and superior Attack outweigh Magmar's movepool. Magmar also competes with Rapidash for a spot on a team as a second Fire-type. Although Rapidash has a much shallower movepool, its higher Speed lets it crucially outspeed Fearow, one of the most dominant Pokemon in the tier. Many of Magmar's moves, such as Confuse Ray and Smokecreen, rely heavily on RNG to work effectively. Its competition with other Fire-types and the inconsistency of some of its moves make Magmar a highly specific Pokemon despite the unique advantages it has.
Comments: Other Options
Magmar can run Fire Blast and Psychic on the same set, having the advantages of Psychic's greater accuracy and Fire Blast's extra damage to Fearow and Scyther. However, Magmar already struggles to fit all the moves it wants. Seismic Toss can be used for consistent damage, but it is largely outclassed by Psychic due to Psychic's super effective coverage against Nidoqueen and Gastly as well as the chance to land a critical hit or a Special drop. Substitute can be used with Confuse Ray to make Magmar even harder to KO, but it is competing against Magmar's array of useful coverage moves. Submission can be used to do extra damage to Omanyte, but Omanyte is rare and already hit decently by Psychic.
Magmar is occasionally used as a lead, forcing the common lead Arcanine into Counter mind games from turn 1 and letting the player keep their own Arcanine healthy. However, even if Magmar beats Arcanine, it will likely be at low HP or paralyzed, making it easy to revenge kill. Additionally, Nidoqueen is a more effective lead if one wants to preserve their Arcanine, since keeping both Nidoqueen and Arcanine in the back can create a Seaking weakness. As a result, lead Magmar is quite uncommon.
Checks and Counters
Paralysis: Magmar's lack of Agility means it hates paralysis much more than Rapidash and Arcanine. Once paralyzed, Magmar struggles to use Confuse Ray effectively, and its frailty means it will be worn down quickly. As a result, Magmar is often forced out by Thunder Wave users such as Porygon and Drowzee.
Water-types: Despite Magmar's better Seaking matchup than Rapidash and Arcanine, it is still far from perfect. Seaking 2HKOes it with Surf, while Magmar needs to hit it with Body Slam three times for Hyper Beam to KO. Although Staryu is not a great check to an unparalyzed Magmar, it 2HKOes it with Surf, while Body Slam into Hyper Beam is not a guaranteed KO. The rare Omanyte can also switch into Magmar and beat it, though Magmar can damage it with Psychic.
Opposing Fire-types: Rapidash and Arcanine are bulkier and faster than Magmar, so they both beat Magmar one-on-one. However, they must be wary of Counter. Once Magmar is confirmed to not have Counter, the two Fire-types beat it. If Rapidash or Arcanine trade paralysis with Magmar, Magmar will be a lot worse off due to its lack of Agility.
Fearow and Scyther: Magmar is much worse into Fearow compared to Rapidash and Arcanine, lacking the Speed of the former and the bulk of the latter. This is amplified if Magmar drops Fire Blast. Magmar doesn't even force Counter mindgames with Fearow since Drill Peck almost always gets it into Hyper Beam range, and Scyther is favored to KO Magmar with a +2 Hyper Beam.
Nidoqueen: Nidoqueen cleanly 2HKOes Magmar with Earthquake. Magmar 3HKOes in return, but it can 2HKO with Psychic if the first one drops Nidoqueen's Special. Fire Blast can burn Nidoqueen, and both moves 2HKO if either hit is a critical hit.
Moveset: Swagmar
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Fire Blast is Magmar's primary STAB move, doing heavy damage to any non-resistant foe. Magmar's higher Special compared to Rapidash and Arcanine means Fire Blast has a higher chance to 2HKO Fearow and OHKO Scyther. Magmar can replace Fire Blast with Psychic, as Psychic hits many of PU's top threats—such as Nidoqueen, Fire-types, Water-types, and Gastly—for the same amount of damage as Fire Blast with 100% accuracy and a chance to drop the foe's Special. This does make Magmar much worse against Fearow and Scyther, though. Body Slam lets Magmar spread paralysis against opposing Fire-types and Seaking, and Hyper Beam can be used to finish off these foes and frail Pokemon, KOing Drowzee, Staryu, and Abra from 51%, 56.6%, and 95.6%, respectively. Magmar can use Counter against opposing Fire-types to punish Normal-type attacks. Even if Magmar isn't running Counter, the threat of the move alone forces the opponent into a guessing game.
Magmar usually uses its fourth move to disrupt Gastly and Seaking. Confuse Ray temporarily reduces Gastly's Hypnosis accuracy to an effective 29.9% and makes it harder for Seaking to set up Agility and hit Magmar with Surf. Although Confuse Ray provides more immediate benefits, Smokescreen hinders Seaking until it switches out, making a late-game sweep much harder to pull off. These moves can also be used in conjunction with paralysis to make it very hard for the foe to hit Magmar and in dire situations to try to defeat a Graveler or Seaking one-on-one. Magmar can also forgo these moves to fit both Hyper Beam and Counter on the same set.
Arcanine is a near-mandatory partner for Magmar, as it is very hard to justify using Magmar over Arcanine. On teams that struggle against Fearow and Scyther, such as teams with physically frail Pokemon like Staryu, Gastly, Drowzee, and Abra, Rapidash is typically better than Magmar due to its Speed. Instead, Magmar shines on teams that are robust against Fearow but struggle against Seaking and Gastly, such as teams with a Scyther or Graveler. Magmar also appreciates Graveler and Scyther's ability to check Fearow and opposing Scyther, especially if it drops Fire Blast. Magmar can also trade hits with Ground-types to enable Magneton, making it a good teammate. Magneton can switch into Fearow's Drill Peck, which Fearow will often use against Magmar due to the threat of Counter.

Format: NU
Overview: Magneton is the hardest-hitting Electric-type in NU, competing with Electrode for a team slot. Magneton brings a number of advantages over its faster competition; firstly, it deals devastating damage, OHKOing Kingler outright with Thunderbolt and having rolls to OHKO every Water- or Flying-type foe with Thunder. Even neutral targets dislike facing Magneton due to its solid bulk and high damage; tier staples like Clefable and Mr. Mime face a 3HKO, and Magneton can even 2HKO it sometimes with Thunderbolt + Thunder. Charizard fares poorly with a mere 14.7% chance to 2HKO Magneton and a 2.6% chance to OHKO it with a critical hit. Even Moltres, the strongest special attacker in the entire game, can only 2HKO Magneton 20% of the time, and it faces a guaranteed 2HKO in return. Magneton has Thunder Wave as well, allowing it to hobble fast foes like Mr. Mime and Raticate that might otherwise deal with it decently.
Of course, Magneton cannot do anything to harm Ground-types, a major matchup flaw that holds it back from prominence. Additionally, despite Magneton's superior offense and bulk, Electrode is generally better regarded than Magneton. Compared to Electrode, Magneton is much slower, failing to outspeed relevant targets like Blastoise, Kingler, Mr. Mime, Raticate, and Charizard, among others. Electrode's Speed and massive critical hit chance often allow it to avoid damage that Magneton cannot, and this critical hit chance also allows it to clean teams off the back of a critical hit OHKO or two. Explosion is also relevant for taking out frail targets like Mr. Mime or dealing significant damage to Nidoking; while both Electric-types are unable to harm Golem, Magneton additionally can't touch Nidoking. Despite this, Magneton can deal a lot of damage against foes like Clefable and Mr. Mime in situations where Electrode might balk at taking paralysis.
Comments: 
Moveset: Offensive
Description: Thunder Wave allows Magneton to hamstring faster foes like Mr. Mime and Blastoise before dealing huge damage. Thunderbolt outright OHKOes Kingler, is a roll to OHKO Kabutops and Fearow, and 2HKOes Flying- and Water-type foes. Thunder, meanwhile, is a roll to OHKO most of these foes barring Moltres. Magneton is actually capable of utilizing Reflect + Rest due to its bulk and ability to spread paralysis, allowing it to potentially stall paralyzed foes like Clefable and Blastoise to recover HP without allowing Swords Dance sweepers safe entry. Since Magneton using Rest will often come by surprise, and the viable Swords Dance users are weak to Thunderbolt, it can usually get away with one Rest against a paralyzed foe. Using Rest without Reflect may allow Magneton to stall an endgame scenario assuming setup sweepers have been dealt with, while Reflect by itself can fend off Clefable, but Magneton will usually want Rest if it has Reflect. Double-Edge is a weak move that can have niche utility in chipping Nidoking for allies to finish off. Toxic is a niche option against Golem when combined with partial trapping from allies like Charizard that can help to wear it down more quickly, but this is inconsistent at best.
Magneton can operate best by looking for chances to get in against Clefable, Wigglytuff, and Blastoise to spread paralysis and deal damage. It also exploits paralyzed Water- and Flying-types, forcing the opponent to choose between sacrificing their Pokemon or switching into a painful Thunderbolt. Magneton pairs well with allies that can cover for its horrid matchup into Ground-types, like Seadra and Blastoise. It also aids allies that benefit from paralysis, like Nidoking, Golem, and Kingler. Like most Pokemon, Magneton also enjoys support from Venomoth to remove its checks with Sleep Powder and weaken other foes with Stun Spore; this is particularly nice for Magneton due to its uniquely unwinnable matchups. Venomoth can also run Mega Drain to help weaken or outright defeat Golem, freeing up Magneton to go on the offensive.

Overview: Magneton fills a specific role as a strong special attacker that lures Ground-type Pokemon. It boasts the most powerful Thunderbolt in the tier, notably threatening to 2HKO defensive staples like Vaporeon and Tentacruel. Ground-types such as Dugtrio and Golem regularly come in to attempt punishing it for its poor coverage, which can be exploited by aggressively switching in Ground-type checks like Articuno, Tangela, and Dragonite. Given its low Speed, Magneton is also one of the better ways to punish paralyzed Pokemon.
However, Magneton faces a myriad of issues that cause it to be forgone on most teams. Its terribly slow Speed leaves it hard to switch in and susceptible to Wrappers such as Tentacruel, Dragonite, and Pinsir. Its coverage is atrocious, leaving it struggling versus Ground- and Grass-types like Dugtrio, Tangela, Venusaur, and the occasional Golem. While it can act as bait that creates opportunities for Pokemon like Tangela and Articuno, relying constantly on prediction leads to Magneton being inconsistent. Magneton also dislikes paralysis, as it loses its ability to outspeed slower and paralyzed foes. It competes with Electabuzz, which outclasses it in all areas but raw damage, and with Raichu and Electrode, both faster Pokemon with more distinguishing features like Surf or Explosion.

Description: Thunderbolt threatens 2HKOs Vaporeon, Tentacruel, Articuno, Persian, Omastar, Dewgong, and Kangaskhan, as well as OHKOs Dodrio, Gyarados, and Aerodactyl. Thunder Wave gives Magneton a tool to cripple faster Wrappers such as Tentacruel and sweepers such as Persian and Electabuzz. Double-Edge is Magneton's best option for combatting Dugtrio and Grass-types, although its poor Attack stat makes the damage output low, with only a slim chance to 3HKO Dugtrio. Rest grants Magneton greater longevity, with the multitude of Wrappers in the tier granting it chances to burn sleep turns. However, a sleeping Magneton is setup fodder for Agility users, namely Dragonite, Articuno, and Dodrio. Alternatively, Toxic punishes Dugtrio, Tangela, and Golem, with Golem being forced to use Explosion much earlier and take chip damage if repeatedly switched in.
Magneton's movepool is rather poor, so its customization options are minimal. Thunder turns many of Thunderbolt's possible KOs into guaranteed ones. However, its poor accuracy makes it inconsistent. Hyper Beam is Magneton's strongest attack versus Kadabra, Venusaur, and Dugtrio, but the recharge turns often leave Magneton in terrible situations. Rest and Toxic could be used together, granting Magneton longevity versus Wrappers. However, this forces you to either decrease the consistency of your paralysis spreading or make Magneton completely toothless versus Dugtrio.
Magneton pairs especially well with Dugtrio checks, as it often baits Dugtrio into switching in. Tangela works well with this, taking minimal damage from Earthquake and Rock Slide and threatening back with status or Mega Drain. Pokemon like Dragonite and Articuno can also work well with this strategy. Dragonite can trade with Dugtrio by using Blizzard as Dugtrio uses Toxic to stop a possible AgiliWrap sweep, putting Dugtrio in KO range of Magneton's Double-Edge. Articuno can switch in and set up on the Ground- and Grass-types that Magneton lures, and Magneton threatens Articuno's checks like Vaporeon and Omastar with 2HKOs.

Overview: Marowak has fringe viability as a result of being mostly outclassed by Sandslash, which has higher stats in everything except Defense, and even that's still equal. Marowak does have access to unique options in Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Counter, which can help against threats such as Pinsir and Fearow, but in general Sandslash's access to Swords Dance and Rock Slide is more useful. Sandslash itself isn't even that good as a result of its mediocre Speed and special bulk, so Marowak has little hope in this tier.
Comments: 
Moveset: Standard
Description: Earthquake is a decently powerful STAB attack coming off of Marowak's usable base 80 Attack. Body Slam lets Marowak spread paralysis. Blizzard has a 72.2% chance to 2HKO Fearow and can 3HKO Grass-types such as Vileplume. Fire Blast has a 99.1% chance to 2HKO Pinsir and also hits Grass-types. Counter can be used over either elemental attack to help Marowak surprise and potentially KO certain threats such as Fearow and Pinsir, as Counter tends to deal over 50% to them.
Given that Marowak is outclassed by Sandslash, one of the only ways to justify using it as a wallbreaker is alongside Sandslash, though such teams need numerous checks to Water-types, such as Staryu and Drowzee, to not immediately fall apart. Otherwise, the only reason to use Marowak would be its slightly better Pinsir and Fearow matchups due to its unique coverage. Marowak enjoys paralysis support, as this eliminates one of its biggest issues, its awful Speed.

Format: Uber
Overview: Mew is recommended to feature on all of your RBY Ubers teams and is one of only two Uber Pokemon—Pokemon banned from standard first generation play dating back to the earliest Nintendo sponsored tournaments. The mythical Pokemon may learn every TM, but it is uncommon in high-level play to see it without Swords Dance. Mew is the tier's premier physical sweeper; its base 100 stats all around let it outspeed Jynx and Speed tie with Zapdos, have an unboosted Attack stat equivalent to Tauros, and have bulk rivaling Snorlax's. Additionally, Soft-Boiled can capitalize on Mew's impressive bulk and Reflect can enhance it, which also makes Mew one of the top physical walls in the tier; conversely, it can sacrifice itself with Explosion to hopefully take another high-value Pokemon down with it. As a Special sweeper, it is outclassed by its clone, Mewtwo, which has Amnesia and a far superior Special stat, as well as by Amnesia Slowbro. Also, Mew's wallbreaking tool, STAB Psychic, is weaker than Alakazam's and Exeggutor's Psychics due to their higher Special stats.
Comments: Other Options
Mega Kick and Double-Edge are single-turn attacks more powerful than Body Slam, but, in addition to their respective poor accuracy and recoil, they lack Body Slam's paralysis chance. Ice Beam or Blizzard used with Reflect threatens to freeze opposing Mew, and both inflict more damage onto Exeggutor, Golem, Rhydon, and Zapdos before Swords Dance boosts, but both force Mew to give up offensive potential.
A couple of consecutive Seismic Toss used without reply can get paralyzed Mew not behind Reflect in Explosion's KO range.
Checks and Counters
Status: Since Mew has to set up before inflicting heavy damage, even Pokemon with somewhat weak defenses can paralyze it with Thunder Wave before switching out the following turn. Like any Pokemon, Mew doesn't appreciate the sleep status either.
Opposing Mew: Any Mew set with both Reflect and Soft-Boiled is a good Mew answer. Thunder Wave paralyzes Mew, and Swords Dance combined with Explosion can take both Mew out of the picture. Swords Dance-boosted attacks also attempt to KO the other Mew.
Gengar: Mew without Earthquake generally lacks the means to deal any damage to Gengar, usually firing off a Thunder Wave at most.
Snorlax: Reflect Snorlax is particularly effective against Mew lacking Earthquake, as +6 Body Slam is only a 4HKO against Snorlax behind Reflect. Snorlax can use Rest to recover health and is immune to Body Slam paralysis. It can paralyze Mew with its own Body Slam, though, and can deal at least 74% damage with Self-Destruct—assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect's boost.
Rhydon and Golem: Both Rhydon and Golem can exploit Mew lacking Earthquake. Rhydon's Substitutes aren't broken by even a +6 Body Slam most of the time. In return, Rhydon is extremely likely to 3HKO with Earthquake, assuming Mew doesn't have Reflect up. Golem lacks the same power and bulk as Rhydon but can threaten with a 64% or more damage Explosion. Explosion's usage can be predictable though, and Golem finds Reflect Mew extremely tough to break down. Rhydon manages to dismantle Body Slam variants with Leer or stall with Substitute and Rest.
Articuno: Although considered to have low viability, Articuno makes for a solid check to the typical Mew; it is immune to Earthquake, and unboosted Body Slam from Mew isn't even a guaranteed 6HKO. Blizzard 3HKOes Mew in return. Articuno can also run Reflect; unlike Snorlax, it isn't immune to Body Slam paralysis, though.
Cloyster: Cloyster functions similarly to Articuno, except for it not being immune to Earthquake. It notably suffers from a less-powerful Blizzard but instead has an improved Defense stat.
Zapdos: Mew is only a match for Reflect Zapdos when fully boosted. In the meantime, Zapdos can deal a minimum of 30% damage with Thunderbolt, forcing Mew to recover, while threatening possible critical hits. Mew recovering, especially from critical hits, gives extra opportunities for Thunderbolt's 10.2% chance of inflicting paralysis—assuming Mew isn't already paralyzed.
Exeggutor: Exeggutor is resistant to Earthquake and is usually only 6HKOed by Mew's Body Slam without boosts. It threatens Mew out with potential Stun Spore and Sleep Powder. It can also do 58% damage minimum to Mew with Explosion if Reflect is not up.
Slowbro: Slowbro can paralyze Mew with Thunder Wave or set up Reflect or Withdraw with paralysis support. Slowbro's Surf has a small chance of 2HKOing at +2 Special.
Tauros: Tauros, which is faster than Mew when not paralyzed, can take it out with enough critical hits or full paralysis triggerings. Tauros benefits from its immunity to Body Slam paralysis, though the matchup slowly reverses as Swords Dance Mew gains its Attack boosts.
Mewtwo: If necessary, Mewtwo can 2HKO Mew on average at +2 Special. Mew, on the other hand, only 3HKOes at +2 Attack unless it possesses Hyper Beam.
Moveset: Traditional Sweeper
Description: Set Description
Mew's traditional aim is to set up with Swords Dance, recover from any damage via Soft-Boiled, and then attempt to sweep with its two attacks. Earthquake is generally Mew's most damaging attack, OHKOing Gengar and 2HKOing Golem and Rhydon at +2 Attack. Body Slam hits Zapdos and Exeggutor neutrally, albeit being initially weak; it also aims to paralyze targets including opposing Mew, using paralysis and damage to pressure it to recover or use Explosion. At +6 Attack, Body Slam has guaranteed 2HKOs on every Pokemon that isn't Cloyster, behind Reflect or Defense boosts, or a Rock- or Ghost-type. Hyper Beam provides a more powerful move to finish off targets besides Golem, Rhydon, or Gengar, but additional paralysis support and care to avoid being exploited by Transform Mew are advised. Another downside of Hyper Beam is the risk that +4 or +6 Attack Hyper Beam is weakened by one of Mew's 19.5% likely critical hits, which can cost it the KO and force Mew to recharge. Soft-Boiled is the choice for longevity, but often Explosion can be useful to cancel out an opposing Mew in an advantageous position.

Moveset: GGMew (Reflect Sweeper)
Description: Set Description
This set was popularised during various RBY Ubers tournaments in 2016. It simultaneously performs well against opposing Mew and sets up to sweep. Thanks to Reflect, it can't be KOed by another Mew outside of a +4 Explosion—given no status, enough PP, and consistent recovery. The downside is having to choose between Body Slam or Earthquake; however, when you consider the viable Pokemon in the tier, your opponent will probably have at most two Pokemon that your chosen move cannot hit neutrally or super effectively. Body Slam is the slightly preferred choice due to it hitting Exeggutor and Zapdos, which are collectively considered more viable than Gengar and Rhydon. It also has 8 more PP, and Gengar and Rhydon can be baited into weakening themselves fighting Mew's teammates prior to revealing the set. Earthquake is usually more effective as a counter-team option because, like the traditional sweeper set, opting out of Body Slam for Earthquake means it is best to search for paralysis support. Soft-Boiled is recommended to take advantage of Reflect more.

Moveset: Explosive Lure
Description: Set Description
This set exists to nullify an opposing Mew. Once your Mew has landed a Thunder Wave, the opposing Mew is slowed down and vulnerable to full paralysis. Next, boost with Swords Dance so that, on any following turn, Mew is ready to take it down with Explosion. If the opposing Mew uses Reflect, boost your Mew's Attack stat all the way up to +6 if you can in order to guarantee an OHKO with Explosion. Alternatively, you can chip the opposing Mew with Body Slam or Earthquake before delivering a +4 Explosion. With enough paralysis luck, your Mew may be able to KO the opposing Mew and save its Explosion for another Pokemon. Reflect can be used in this set to stall needing to use Explosion, although, since Mew's only attack will be Explosion, it relies on your opponent not playing around it and either giving away a less valuable Pokemon or sending in Gengar, Golem, or Rhydon. This set can also function as an emergency Mewtwo check; it is only 2HKOed by 999 Special Mewtwo, so Mew can reliably paralyze Mewtwo, and it does a minimum of 63% damage with an unboosted Explosion.

Moveset: Lutrew / PaRaSiTe Mew (Transform)
Description: Set Description
This set was created by Lutra in the mid-2010s to counter traditional Swords Dance Mew sets—particularly the Hyper Beam variant—and greatly departs from the traditional sweeper set. Once in against opposing Mew, use Thunder Wave and Reflect first as it sets up Swords Dance, use Soft-Boiled if needed to stay healthy, and, finally, use Transform. This sequence makes your Mew into the traditional sweeper set with the bonus of Reflect protection and an opposing Mew that can become fully paralyzed. If you make your Mew transform before its target reaches +6, it can use Swords Dance again to both boost itself and lower its target's Speed under paralysis. The Reflect sweeper set, unfortunately, ruins it plans, stalling it out by taking advantage of Transform's 5 PP. This set will also result in a stalemate with fellow Transform Mew, possibly resulting in an endless battle. Worse yet, its lack of offensive threat means the opponent can easily switch to another Pokemon.

Format: Uber
Overview: Feast your eyes on the most destructive Pokemon in any tier in history. Not one stat Mewtwo has can be called bad or even average, including the highest Special in the game and a tie with Aerodactyl and Jolteon for second-highest Speed. It's not just an offensive juggernaut: Mewtwo's bulk is absolutely titanic, stomaching even blows from the mighty Snorlax and Tauros. Its Psychic typing comes into this as well, giving it effectively no type-based weaknesses to exploit. Because of these qualities, taking Mewtwo down often requires a concentrated effort from multiple Pokemon. As if that wasn't enough, it has a plethora of fantastic moves, such as Amnesia, Recover, STAB Psychic, Self-Destruct, and more. If given even a single turn of breathing room, Mewtwo can immediately take over a game. There is no true way to defeat Mewtwo head-on other than sending in your own, statusing it, or getting plain lucky. Thus, many RBY Ubers games are decided by a Mewtwo mirror match. Mewtwo was designed to be the world's strongest Pokemon, and Game Freak certainly succeeded: Mewtwo has zero inarguable flaws and is an automatic pick on any RBY Ubers team that aims to win.
Mewtwo's only arguable flaws stem from it being quite literally too powerful for a Game Boy to process. A maximum DV and EV Mewtwo can end up overflowing its Special if it's boosted to +4 or higher and subsequently sustains a Special drop, minimizing its Special and leaving it effortless to KO. Similarly, Mewtwo's Speed gives it a very high critical hit rate—25.39%—which, combined with the fact that critical hits ignore the attacker's offensive boosts, means that +3 or higher Mewtwo will sometimes deal less damage than expected. Finally, while Mewtwo is incredible, it will always have some check it has trouble beating outside of brute force, as it often only has two moveslots available after Amnesia and Recover. However, brute force remains a fine option in a tight spot because Mewtwo is an utter juggernaut.
Comments: Other Options
To prevent Mewtwo's Special from overflowing, 8 EVs and 13 DVs in Special can make the stat 341 on any given Mewtwo set, which amounts to 1023 at +4, albeit capped at 999 in practice. This is known as the "SafeTwo" spread, pioneered by Enigami. Doing this, however, severely cuts into Mewtwo's bulk, making critical hits from special attacks deal noticeably higher damage. Thus, using this spread depends on whether your Mewtwo set aims for short-term reward or maximum mileage throughout a game.
If a move is good in RBY, there is a good chance that Mewtwo learns it. Customizing Mewtwo usually consists of patching up offensive holes in a team while ensuring it doesn't leave itself open to its checks; in other words, without compromising its power level or making it more situational. Generally, Mewtwo's only free moveslot is one of its two attacking ones, as Amnesia and Recover are pivotal to its success.
Rest is an interesting choice over Recover, especially on Barrier + Amnesia sets, which generally aim to last as long as possible, as it stalls for three turns at the cost of 1 PP, effectively amounting to 48 PP. It also comes with erasing the Speed drop from paralysis when switching out, though this can make Mewtwo somewhat difficult to wake up later if it hasn't woken up prior to switching; this is because Mewtwo regularly attracts self-KO move users like Snorlax and Golem, which it can't contest when asleep. Even worse, Swords Dance Mew can often set up and break through Mewtwo right away if not chipped or paralyzed, so it's recommended to incapacitate it with a teammate first. Rest also notably removes Mewtwo's paralysis, and paralysis arguably helps with PP stalling more, as it ensures it doesn't remain passive for extended periods of time.
Mewtwo can potentially make use of the strong elemental attacks of RBY—Fire Blast, Blizzard, and Thunder—but they come with significant PP issues. Mewtwo mirrors often result in both losing a very large amount of PP, and putting your own at such a deficit right away frequently results in a loss. Additionally, each comes with its own disadvantage from a status perspective: Fire Blast's burn chance means it can thaw frozen Pokemon, while Blizzard and Thunder have less overall chance to inflict status because of their lower PP. Because Mewtwo often needs the superior status chances, the increased damage output is often just not worth it. This is to say nothing of the accuracy issues, which decrease the consistency of the one Pokemon that you can't afford to be inconsistent. However, the increased damage still leaves them situationally acceptable on teams able to PP stall Mewtwo without using their own Mewtwo; for example, +2 Blizzard or Fire Blast can OHKO Exeggutor, and an unboosted Thunder KOes Cloyster with even minor chip damage.
Mewtwo's Attack is very usable, which makes Body Slam and Hyper Beam seem enticing. Body Slam can allow Mewtwo to spread paralysis while dealing physical damage, but compared to everything else Mewtwo can dish out, it's generally unimpressive. Hyper Beam is particularly interesting, as Mewtwo can then KO Chansey from a minimum of 44.6%. Against Mewtwo, a critical hit deals slightly more damage than Self-Destruct. Thus, it can be used as a substitute for BooM2 sets to try and get opposing Mewtwo in range for a critical hit or regular Hyper Beam instead of Self-Destruct. However, against any non-Psychic resistant Pokemon, including Chansey, the damage dealt is almost the same as +4 Psychic. Further, Psychic comes with the bonuses of not requiring a recharge, Special drops to further increase damage, and more attacking PP. Ergo, the only non-opposing Mewtwo reason to use Hyper Beam is for a better Light Screen Chansey matchup, which, while common, isn't omnipresent. If you're looking for a physical option, Submission is often the superior choice for hitting Chansey harder than Hyper Beam and having a significant PP advantage for Mewtwo.
Mewtwo has fantastic physical bulk, making Counter appear viable. However, Counter is often best placed on Chansey, a Pokemon with higher potential damage that often draws physical attackers like Snorlax in more consistently. Mewtwo has little opportunity to use the attack, as it's often faced with opposing Mewtwo or Chansey before it even gets the chance to use it. Ergo, should these matchups come down to PP stalling, there is a very high chance that Counter will be revealed by force, ruining the gimmick entirely.
BooM2 sets can arguably run Seismic Toss to make KOing opposing Mewtwo with Self-Destruct easier, making it a much more effective lure. However, fitting this into the set is extremely difficult and worsens its matchups against essentially anything other than Mewtwo, which it can't often afford. It's also possible to drop Amnesia entirely on these types of sets to add more coverage options or secure a slot for Recover, but this has seen little success.
Checks and Counters
Mewtwo: Mewtwo is arguably the best check to itself. The combination of Amnesia and Recover means your standard Amnesia set has a lot of trouble breaking through, requiring three critical hits in a row with Thunderbolt or Ice Beam to get the KO. Using Self-Destruct is one way to attempt to break through an opposing Mewtwo, but this requires sacrificing your own, and even then you only OHKO with a critical hit. This means even using Self-Destruct requires you to have the team support and setup necessary to finish Mewtwo off. Another option is having enough PP to successfully stall Mewtwo out; Submission is a great way to accomplish this, thanks to the 48 PP it offers. However, it oftentimes simply comes down to which Mewtwo will be frozen first, as getting a freeze often leaves nothing left to handle a boosted Mewtwo.
Freezing: Thanks to freeze being the virtual equivalent of a KO, freezing Mewtwo is often the best way to deal with it. Common Pokemon like Jynx, Starmie, Slowbro, and Chansey run Ice Beam or Blizzard, which both carry a 10.1% freeze chance. Additionally, these Pokemon are typically able to take a hit from even a boosted Mewtwo, meaning every turn spent against them carries a degree of risk. Managing to freeze the opponent's Mewtwo is a way to gain massive momentum, freeing up your own Mewtwo or Slowbro to wreak havoc with their biggest check out of the way.
Light Screen Chansey: As a testament to just how powerful Mewtwo is, the phenomenal special wall Chansey must run Light Screen to truly be a check. However, it's one of the most consistent Mewtwo checks in the game. A Mewtwo boosted to the 999 cap only possesses a 17.4% chance to 4HKO with Psychic through Light Screen. With Ice Beam and Thunderbolt, it's only a possible 6HKO. Chansey is one of the most consistent methods of overflowing a +6 Mewtwo's Special as well, using Psychic's Special drop chance and subsequently forcing a switch. Additionally, Chansey often has a significant PP advantage. This means Chansey can wall Mewtwo and force it to burn precious PP while healing off the damage it deals. However, even Chansey isn't safe. Psychic's 33.2% Special drop can degrade Light Screen and make Chansey much more vulnerable, making it arguably a temporary solution. Submission also 2HKOes it 86.7% of the time, making for a great anti-Chansey measure. Chansey is also a magnet for freeze attempts, which can be either a sigh of relief for your own Mewtwo or a catastrophic situation depending on your team's defensive integrity and Mewtwo set.
Mew: Mew has some interesting tricks that can allow it to check, set up on, or otherwise handle Mewtwo. With paralysis support and Swords Dance, it can set up to +4 Attack and then 2HKO with Earthquake while virtually never being 3HKOed in return by 999 Special Ice Beam or Thunderbolt. At +6, Mew is capable of OHKOing Mewtwo with Hyper Beam. Alternatively, some Mew variants simply opt to use Swords Dance and then Explosion to erase Mewtwo from the battle without any doubt. Defensively, Mew can use Transform to copy Mewtwo's stats and moves. Transform leaves Mew vulnerable for a turn, but the player gains crucial information about the opposing Mewtwo's set, walls it completely, and gains 5 PP for each move it holds. This 5 PP resets each time Mew uses Transform, meaning it is able to PP stall the opposing Mewtwo. It's not like Transform Mew only has the opposing Mewtwo's attacks either, as it can run other options to cripple it prior. These include Thunder Wave, Explosion to take a big chunk out of its health, Reflect to increase defensive integrity while transformed, and Soft-Boiled to stay healthy. Unless Mewtwo lands multiple critical hits or inflicts status, Mew is able to come in and check it somewhat consistently. However, Mew is far from an ironclad Mewtwo check; without paralysis support, Mewtwo is able to muscle through Mew on most occasions through brute force, as well as often ruining it completely with an untimely freeze.
PP Stall: Stalling Mewtwo out of PP is another way to deal with it, usually attempted with your own Mewtwo or Light Screen Chansey. Once it runs out of attacking PP, it's little more than a status absorber. However, accomplishing this is much easier said than done. With its monstrous Special, critical hit rate, and coverage, PP stall can sometimes be in vain, as crucial team members can fall to a freeze or massive damage. If Mewtwo lacks Thunderbolt, Slowbro is able to stand in its way, stalling PP while setting up its own brutal sweep. Thanks to its own Amnesia and Rest, Slowbro has a good chance to win one-on-one as well.
Paralysis: Paralyzing Mewtwo can open opportunities for powerful Pokemon such as Snorlax, Tauros, Mew, Golem, and Rhydon. Getting in on a paralyzed Mewtwo and being able to fire off big hits or threaten Explosion or Self-Destruct often forces it out. However, paralyzing Mewtwo can actually benefit it, as it can now no longer be frozen or put to sleep, and skipping turns with paralysis lets Mewtwo PP stall more effectively. Generally, Mewtwo despises being paralyzed early on, as it loses momentum against Mew, Snorlax, and Mewtwo specifically tailored to break through opposing Mewtwo. However, later on, when Mew and Snorlax have likely been taken out, Mewtwo tends to appreciate paralysis more. If you have the tools on your team to take advantage of a paralyzed Mewtwo early on, then it is absolutely worth it, as finding a way to break the opposing Mewtwo without risking your own is a key way to win consistently in RBY Ubers.
Slowbro: Slowbro is a fairly notorious check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo, being able to set up freely or even PP stall it if all goes well. The only risk to Slowbro in this scenario is a freeze from Ice Beam, which can be somewhat made up for with Rest preventing further status. Slowbro can also muscle past non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo through Thunder Wave and +6 Surf, which will eventually 4HKO a +6 Mewtwo and deal mortal damage otherwise. However, if Mewtwo has Thunderbolt, Slowbro will be 3HKOed even at +6 if Mewtwo is also at +6.
Self-KO Moves: The sheer power of Self-Destruct and Explosion makes them common methods of dispatching Mewtwo, primarily because it's often the highest-value Pokemon on its team and normally the most threatening. These strategies are at their most potent when Mewtwo is paralyzed, as it ends up becoming slower than the strongest users of self-KO moves in the game, namely Snorlax and Golem. While not even a STAB Self-Destruct from Snorlax will OHKO Mewtwo, it will often leave it in a position to be revenge killed by Pokemon like Tauros. Snorlax can also use Body Slam and then Self-Destruct, which is a guaranteed KO. Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets are often expressly made to trade against opposing Mewtwo too, and it's often paired with deadly sweepers like Slowbro, which become significantly more threatening with Mewtwo off the table. While their Explosions are quite weak, Gengar and Electrode also tend to Explode against Mewtwo, coming very close to OHKOing it on a critical hit.
Moveset: Standard
Description: Set Description
Mewtwo's defining set makes full use of the incredible Amnesia. With its astronomical Special, Amnesia leaves it almost impossible to switch into until it's scouted and just as hard to KO with special moves. A Mewtwo boosted up to the maximum of 999 Special can only fall to three or more critical hit special attacks. This tremendous bulk and Recover allow Mewtwo to stay healthy while hammering away. However, after these two mandatory moves, Mewtwo's coverage is impressive and has multiple viable options, making it a multifaceted threat able to plow through just about everything. The coverage options you choose will largely decide what your Mewtwo's primary role is.
Mewtwo's STAB Psychic is one of the scariest no-drawback moves in the game. A 33.2% chance to drop Special as an added bonus can allow Mewtwo to muscle through something like Light Screen Chansey. The Special drops can also be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing paralyzed Mewtwo to outspeed an opposing paralyzed Mewtwo or incapacitate it for something else to handle; because of this, a paralyzed Mewtwo isn't out of the game just yet. Finally, Psychic has a significant benefit in causing an opposing +4 Mewtwo's Special to overflow if it doesn't have a "SafeTwo" stat spread, which consists of 13 DVs and 8 EVs in Special to ensure it starts at 341. Unfortunately, with the bevy of Psychic-types in Ubers, Mewtwo's targets are often resistant and thus take Psychic decently before striking back. Common examples include Exeggutor, Slowbro, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo.
Slotting in Thunderbolt gives Mewtwo some unique coverage possibilities while bringing its PP up to 104. Mewtwo is now able to easily beat Slowbro; if both boost to the 999 cap, Mewtwo still 3HKOes with Thunderbolt, and that's to say nothing of its 25.39% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Thunderbolt also gives Mewtwo access to paralysis. While the odds are slim, this can help Mewtwo and teammates immensely against opposing Mewtwo and Chansey. You're statistically likely to get at least one instance of paralysis from Thunderbolt's full PP, so it's fair to fish for it. On the downside, using it in the third moveslot means Mewtwo lets Exeggutor in for free, as it's only 3HKOed by a 999 Special Psychic from full HP; it can then use this opportunity to spread status or use Explosion. You also lose out on the potential to freeze by forgoing Ice Beam, which can really hurt against Chansey, Mew, and opposing Mewtwo. Also, paralyzed Mewtwo can inadvertently allow Rhydon a free switch should it use Thunderbolt or Recover, which puts it in a very difficult spot, as Rhydon can fish for Substitute on full paralysis and 3HKO with Earthquake from there.
Ice Beam slots in nicely alongside Psychic, and the biggest reason is the 10.1% freeze chance. While the coverage is nice to help deal with Exeggutor, Ice Beam's primary draw is to freeze opposing Mewtwo, or less ideally, one of its major checks, like Chansey. This can open up the entire game and oftentimes win it outright. However, Slowbro is able to soak up this set's hits and use Amnesia, Thunder Wave, and Rest to have a good chance to beat Mewtwo head-on. Additionally, while Starmie doesn't pose much of a threat offensively, it can also paralyze Mewtwo or attempt to freeze it; it can take at least one hit from a Mewtwo with this coverage boosted up to 999. Opponents must be careful though, as +4 Psychic will 2HKO Starmie. Another drawback to this set is the mere 96 total PP, which can often become crucial when battling against other Mewtwo and trying to break down Chansey. This makes freezing the wrong Pokemon possibly quite deadly, as opposing Mewtwo tend to win from there through PP stall. When using Psychic + Ice Beam, it's best to avoid paralyzing the opposing Mewtwo in favor of winning by PP stall or freezing it.
Even without a STAB option, Mewtwo still threatens the entire metagame with BoltBeam coverage. Instead of using its STAB Psychic, it can combine the coverage and benefits of Ice Beam and Thunderbolt while reaching 104 PP. While lacking Psychic means it no longer KOes the powerful and Self-Destruct-using Snorlax after some chip damage, the coverage allows Mewtwo to deal with almost everything else. It gains the advantage against both Slowbro and Exeggutor while bearing a 10.1% freeze chance for opposing Mewtwo, Mew, or Chansey. Since it handles almost the entire metagame besides these three Pokemon and Snorlax, it can blow the game wide open by freezing one of them. One drawback to this set is that, if your opponent has both Chansey and Mewtwo active, it will only be able to take out one while being walled by the other because of relying on a freeze. However, you can use Thunderbolt to attempt paralysis, meaning Mewtwo isn't completely shut down and can still help its team against these threats. Boosted up to 999, Mewtwo is able to OHKO Slowbro, Exeggutor, Tauros, and Starmie to name a few, making this combination a Swiss Army knife that is very difficult to deal with.
A unique option that Mewtwo can run is Submission. First, Submission holds a whopping 48 PP, bringing the total to 128 if using Ice Beam, or 136 if using Thunderbolt. This lets Mewtwo win PP wars against opposing Mewtwo consistently while having the advantage against Chansey. One must be careful of getting frozen though. Submission destroys Light Screen Chansey, one of Mewtwo's most common adversaries, without risking PP stall. Submission Mewtwo has an 86.7% chance to 2HKO, and with its high critical hit ratio it has a decent chance to OHKO. The primary drawback of this set is only running one special coverage option. Running Thunderbolt is the most common, as this allows Mewtwo to beat all of its most common checks, these being Chansey via Submission, Slowbro via Thunderbolt, and opposing Mewtwo via PP stall. However, this set struggles against Exeggutor and Rhydon, often allowing Explosion or status from the former and giving a free switch in to the latter. Ice Beam can be chosen over Thunderbolt to alleviate this, making the set weak to Slowbro but gaining the advantage against Exeggutor and Rhydon. Having a freeze chance is never bad either. Psychic, on the other hand, should not be chosen here; alongside Submission, it simply leaves Mewtwo vulnerable against too many common Psychic-types.

Description: Set Description
By bluffing the standard set with Amnesia and your chosen coverage option, this Mewtwo can lure in the opposing Mewtwo, occasionally paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and then use Self-Destruct after some chip damage. Self-Destruct also comes with the bonus of beating set-up Slowbro, which is otherwise a common check to the set.
Self-Destruct will KO opposing Mewtwo from 52.2% minimum, which means two uses of +2 Thunderbolt will set it up. It's recommended to run Thunderbolt, as well as paralysis support, to make it harder for the opposing Mewtwo to heal its way out of Self-Destruct range with Recover. Other options tend to only make this set worse, as matching up worse against Slowbro usually forces Mewtwo to use Self-Destruct. The normally ubiquitous Recover can be dropped for Thunder Wave, which guarantees that Mewtwo can use Self-Destruct before the opposing one can heal out of KO range. Naturally, this also means Mewtwo itself should avoid getting paralyzed whenever possible, or it becomes very difficult to succeed.
This set carries inherent risks, as Self-Destruct is naturally inconsistent: it being absorbed by Gengar or Rhydon can be a game loss, and less common Mewtwo sets using Flash or even Barrier match up extremely well against it. However, it remains viable for the sheer reward the trade can provide. If supported by Seismic Toss Chansey, the set can be more consistent at securing trades, as two uses of Seismic Toss can also put opposing Mewtwo in KO range.

Moveset: Staller
Description: Set Description
Mewtwo can focus on stalling, which can be approached in two ways: Flash or Barrier. While they play differently in practice, the aim is very similar, that being stonewalling opposing Mewtwo. Because of the long-term role of these sets, the "SafeTwo" Special stat is highly recommended; the given spread gives Mewtwo a Special stat of 341, which ensures that it hits 1023 Special at +4, meaning that a Special drop does not trigger an overflow. Mewtwo's attacking option on this type of set largely depends on the rest of the team, and it only has one, so care should be taken. Thunderbolt hits Mew and Slowbro while giving Mewtwo the best PP advantage; however, Rhydon becomes extremely threatening, especially if running Flash. Alternatively, Ice Beam lets Mewtwo muscle past Exeggutor and Rhydon, as well as providing the option of freezing the opposing Mewtwo, possibly cutting off the Flash interaction early. STAB Psychic can serve as a generic option on Barrier sets, being the strongest attack Mewtwo has and also giving it the best shot of beating Snorlax before it paralyzes with Body Slam or uses Self-Destruct.
The Flash approach aims to gain the most advantage in the Mewtwo mirror match without making a trade, so it should be kept in waiting until that opportunity arises. It works most effectively against Ice Beam Mewtwo, as Flash can decrease the opposing Mewtwo's chance of freezing your own while also giving a PP advantage against all standard sets, totaling to 112 PP with Psychic or Ice Beam, or 120 if running Thunderbolt. This forces the opponent to either switch out and risk losing a Pokemon or stay in and inevitably lose if enough accuracy drops set in. Attacking the opposing Mewtwo is generally unnecessary; stalling its attacking PP is all you need, leaving yourself with a fully boosted Mewtwo to wreak havoc thereafter. This set isn't wholly opposed to being paralyzed—skipping turns is arguably beneficial once the accuracy drops have piled on, though paralysis does drastically decrease its consistency prior to that.
The combination of Barrier and Amnesia can be used instead to turn Mewtwo into a sweeper that also has a large PP advantage against opposing Mewtwo, which can be 112 PP with Recover added on, not factoring in offensive options. This alone is enough to PP stall any standard Mewtwo set, allowing you to end up with a fully boosted Mewtwo by the time they run out. It is strongly recommended to get this Mewtwo paralyzed as soon as possible, as this further improves its PP stalling capabilities and ensures it cannot get frozen later. With the assistance of Barrier, exploding on Mewtwo becomes an impossibility without something like Swords Dance + Explosion Mew, which forces the opposing team to PP stall it themselves. Even the mighty Snorlax, with the strongest physical move in STAB Self-Destruct, rarely hits for even a quarter of +6 Barrier Mewtwo's health. This set works especially well against Self-Destruct Mewtwo sets, as they cannot afford a PP war and lose the ability to KO it from half HP due to the Defense boost. While still vulnerable to critical hits, Mewtwo is very difficult to KO after boosting both Defense and Special, often surviving for astonishing periods of time.
The main drawback to stall-centric Mewtwo sets is that they often require some momentum to function; Flash usually takes multiple hits to begin making your own Mewtwo difficult to hit, and Barrier sets add more turns of setup time. Ergo, any unfortunate luck during these sequences is often devastating, and making your own Mewtwo less consistent must be for good reason. Additionally, because of the aforementioned lack of coverage and specialized nature, stall-centric Mewtwo sets often end up being weaker to Pokemon other than opposing Mewtwo. Depending on the offensive option of choice, Mewtwo can become weak to any of Chansey, Exeggutor, Slowbro, and Transform Mew. Slowbro is the most notable if not running Thunderbolt, being able to accumulate a sizable PP advantage through Rest while having high enough damage output to muscle past with repeated full paralysis. If running Thunderbolt, though, Light Screen Chansey becomes a big threat if not paralyzed, possessing a PP advantage and enough bulk to shrug off what Mewtwo throws at it. Regardless of offensive option and Mewtwo's sheer power, though, Barrier Mewtwo often has limited attacking PP to punish switch stalling, which is worsened when paralyzed. Ergo, teams using this set should make up for its shortcomings. Explosion Mew, Golem, and Self-Destruct Snorlax make fine choices, often making it easier to break through Chansey and Slowbro. Zapdos or Jolteon can also be effective—especially the latter, which tends to have a more consistent Chansey matchup and has a high critical hit rate to break through Slowbro. Slowbro is also an excellent partner, profiting greatly from a Thunderbolt Mewtwo being incapacitated to set up and sweep later.

Strategies:

Format: NU
Overview: Mr. Mime is the best Psychic-type in RBY NU. Its excellent Speed, STAB Psychic, and lack of weaknesses let it work as a lead, wallbreaker, or cleaner, and most teams will have issues checking it with anything other than their own Mr. Mime. Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt grant it the utility and coverage to take on almost any foe, especially given the prevalence of fast foes as well as Water- and Flying-types. It also makes an excellent revenge killer, as few foes outpace it and it is difficult to switch into. Mr. Mime easily beats Blastoise and Venomoth one-on-one, ruins Charizard with Thunder Wave and heavy damage, and even scares Clefable with a critical hit or Special drop. Every single team benefits from Mr. Mime's damage output and Thunder Wave support, so it should never go unused.
That said, Mr. Mime has several weaknesses, including its horrendous physical bulk, vulnerability to Seismic Toss, and difficulty breaking past NU's other Psychic-type, Exeggcute. Many Pokemon, such as Kabutops, Moltres, and Golem, 2HKO Mr. Mime, so it becomes incredibly vulnerable once paralyzed, and Seismic Toss 3HKOes it. Since Mr. Mime is so difficult to check, teams lacking Exeggcute will usually send their own Mr. Mime to trade Thunder Wave, ensuring that at least an ally can finish it off. Clefable, Electrode, and rare niche picks like Porygon, Abra, and Drowzee can also force this trade or force it out. Additionally, while Mr. Mime's Speed is nothing to scoff at, it's still a bit slower than Raticate, Charizard, and Ninetales, so they can beat it one-on-one.
Comments: Other Options
Mr. Mime lacks many other options. Counter is the main option of note, as this turns its physical frailty into a dubious boon, sending back strong attacks like Slash, Super Fang, and Body Slam for massive damage and dealing 70% to opposing Mr. Mime after Seismic Toss. This has several problems though; it is difficult to fit, usually replacing Seismic Toss, and Counter + Thunderbolt fails to KO Mr. Mime. Using Counter on Super Fang cannot KO Raticate, which is also faster and could use Body Slam instead. Slash seems like a good opportunity for Counter, but Charizard may use Fire Blast and often does not run Slash in the first place, while Kabutops is 2HKOed by Thunderbolt and only rarely OHKOed by Counter. Barrier can be used as a tricky move to take Hyper Beam from slower foes like Clefable, Kabutops, and Kingler, but this is very prediction-reliant and many foes have ways around it, such as strong special attacks; it also costs a moveslot that Mr. Mime really cannot afford. Attempting to set it up in advance is fairly pointless, as the opponent can exploit missing coverage once they see it.
Checks and Counters
Psychic-types: Exeggcute's viability hinges on its ability to reliably check Mr. Mime. It's at worst 4HKOed barring critical hits and Special drops, and it threatens sleep and paralysis in return. It can potentially use Explosion to allow a threat like Charizard in freely. Rare options like Drowzee and Abra absorb Mr. Mime's attacks well and threaten status and a 3HKO with Seismic Toss; Drowzee fares better due to its superior bulk, but Abra is capable of hamstringing and chipping Mr. Mime as well. Mr. Mime commonly checks itself as well, coming in after a KO to paralyze and trade hits.
Paralysis: Once Mr. Mime is paralyzed, Pokemon like Golem, Kabutops, Nidoking, and Kingler can crush it. Even special attackers like Blastoise and Seadra handily beat a paralyzed Mr. Mime, and it struggles to switch in against anything but Venomoth. However, its ability to block sleep is very valuable and provides an early-game opportunity to land more damage or paralysis.
Clefable: Clefable is bulky enough to duel Mr. Mime, but a single Special drop vastly worsens this matchup. Thunder Wave permanently reduces Mr. Mime's threat, or Clefable can opt to 3HKO it with Body Slam and potentially paralyze it along the way. Hyper Beam sets fare relatively well against Mr. Mime, often KOing it after Body Slam.
Revenge Killers: Mr. Mime lacks recovery and often takes heavy damage in early- to mid-game fights, leaving it vulnerable to revenge killers like Charizard, Ninetales, and Raticate. Raticate is especially difficult to switch into, but all of these Pokemon also keep Venomoth out, preserving momentum regardless of whether Mr. Mime stays or switches out. Electrode, Fearow, and the rare Arcanine are also effective revenge killers and can beat Mr. Mime one-on-one if necessary.
Golem: Golem is a very tenuous check to Mr. Mime, relying on finding free entry against an Electric-type move. It 2HKOes Mr. Mime with Earthquake, but Mr. Mime 2HKOes Golem given an immediate Special drop or one critical hit, so the odds actually favor Mr. Mime if it is unparalyzed. However, paralysis makes Golem a much safer check, and Explosion OHKOes Mr. Mime, a generally advantageous trade for the Golem user.
Moltres: Moltres Speed ties Mr. Mime and 2HKOes it, while Thunderbolt only 3HKOes it 47% of the time before accounting for critical hits. Moltres can therefore tenuously revenge kill Mr. Mime or, after checks like Kabutops and Golem are removed, take paralysis to set up Agility, defeat Mr. Mime, and proceed to deal heavy damage. This is risky, however, as paralysis reduces Fire Blast's already shaky consistency.
Moveset: Standard
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Psychic 2HKOes Venomoth and Nidoking—its 33% Special drop chance and Mr. Mime's 17.6% critical hit chance often allow it to 2HKO or 3HKO even bulky foes. It's also a spammable option that dents almost any foe, and it puts Charizard and Blastoise in range of a 2HKO from Thunderbolt or a potential OHKO after a critical hit or Special drop. Thunderbolt covers the tier's many Water- and Flying-types, 3HKOing bulkier ones like Blastoise and Charizard and 2HKOing the frailer Kabutops and Kingler. Seismic Toss primarily covers opposing Mr. Mime, 3HKOing it, but it also 3HKOes Abra and 4HKOes Exeggcute. Thunder Wave shuts down fast sweepers and wallbreakers like Charizard and Mr. Mime and maintains a Speed advantage against slower Thunder Wave users; with a Psychic drop reapplying the Speed drop, even paralyzed Charizard, Moltres, and Ninetales become slower than paralyzed Mr. Mime.
Mr. Mime makes an excellent mid-game wallbreaker or late-game cleaner. In both roles, it benefits from allies that can help to remove Thunder Wave users so it can simply attack without fear of paralysis. Wigglytuff can weaken Clefable, Exeggcute shuts down opposing Mr. Mime, and Raticate is a fearsome wallbreaker that can revenge kill Clefable and Mr. Mime effectively. Nidoking benefits heavily from any paralysis Mr. Mime manages to spread, letting it revenge kill opposing Mr. Mime, Charizard, and Raticate. As a wallbreaker, Mr. Mime can help clear the way for teammates like Charizard, Moltres, and Seadra to sweep by removing troublesome Water-types and Thunder Wave users. Defensively, it has difficulty with powerful physical attackers like Golem, so bulky allies like Blastoise and Kingler can help protect it.
Mr. Mime is often used as a lead, threatening opposing leads with paralysis and preventing frustrating scenarios like an early Charizard sweep. In this role, it may sometimes opt to take paralysis and switch out, returning later to blockade Venomoth's sleep attempts and retaliate with Thunder Wave or a powerful attack. This is somewhat risky, so lead Mr. Mime heavily appreciates slower, hard-hitting allies like Golem and Kabutops for opposing leads like Charizard and Mr. Mime; in return, it can protect them from Venomoth putting them to sleep in retaliation. However, usually lead Mr. Mime will stay in, use Thunder Wave, and simply attack until it is KOed, enabling a teammate to revenge kill or letting Venomoth attempt Sleep Powder. In this role, it needs very little support, and the rest of the team can simply focus on enabling Charizard or another sweeper. Mr. Mime is somewhat unhappy to see Venomoth as the opposing lead, as Venomoth may win the Speed tie, and Mr. Mime can only OHKO it with a critical hit. Overall, Venomoth is favored to land Sleep Powder in this matchup, removing a major threat, but Mr. Mime has a chance to simply obliterate it or dodge Sleep Powder and gain a massive advantage.

Overview: Muk possesses a couple useful traits, including solid bulk, good elemental coverage, and the tier's most powerful Explosion. However, it is held back by its Poison typing, which grants it no useful resistances alongside weaknesses to the common Earthquake and Psychic, and low Speed, which means it'll almost always move last. To make matters worse, it is dominated by Gastly, which is only 4HKOed by Fire Blast and is immune to Explosion. While teams lacking Gastly may have some trouble playing around it, Muk is too easy to overwhelm with common threats like Nidoqueen, and thus it's recommended that players avoid using this Pokemon.
Comments: 
Moveset: Mixed Attacker
Description: Body Slam lets Muk threaten switch-ins with paralysis, making it a decent midground option with its okay power, while also dealing decent damage to physically frail Pokemon such as Abra and Staryu. Thunderbolt hits Water-types and Fearow for super effective damage, notably letting Muk beat Omanyte. Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir while threatening Grass-types such as Vileplume and potentially burning physical attackers. It is also Muk's strongest attack against Gastly. Alternatively, Hyper Beam lets Muk OHKO Abra, meaning it need not use Explosion to KO Abra. Explosion is Muk's most powerful attack, OHKOing common threats like Fearow and Rapidash, and it deals a minimum of 72% to Nidoqueen. It also has an 84.6% chance to OHKO Porygon, which is important, since Porygon otherwise stonewalls Muk. However, it must be used carefully, as opposing Gastly, Omanyte, and Graveler can easily switch in and sponge the attack. Alternatively, the opposing player can sacrifice a weakened foe, which stops Muk from removing a crucial piece of their team.
Mega Drain is an option to threaten Graveler, though it only 2HKOing 40.7% of the time means Muk still risks losing one-on-one. It also lets Muk beat Omanyte if it forgoes Thunderbolt. Acid Armor can let Muk survive more hits from physical attackers, especially if it uses it while they switch in, though Fearow can easily bypass Muk's boosts with its high critical hit rate, and Pinsir's Slash will always do so.
Given that it can switch into all of Muk's moves, even Explosion, Gastly is Muk's worst enemy. Thus, Abra and Drowzee are recommended partners. Drowzee has the added benefit of checking opposing Abra, which also gives Muk a considerable amount of trouble. Graveler doesn't fear anything from Muk besides Mega Drain, so Porygon is a good partner. Earthquake users in Machamp and Nidoqueen can outspeed and 2HKO Muk, so checks to them, like Fearow for the former and one's own Machamp for the latter, can be good to handle these threats for Muk.

Format: UU
Overview: One wouldn’t expect Nidoking to struggle so much in RBY UU. With its impeccable coverage, Electric immunity, and well-rounded stats, one would even question why it isn't dominating. Once the opposing team is weakened, Nidoking becomes very threatening, as it hits nearly everything for neutral damage and can be very difficult to switch into. Moreover, it can freely pivot into an incoming Toxic, as well as Electric-type attacks like Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt from Electabuzz and Haunter, giving it some decent defensive utility. With adequate paralysis support from Pokemon like Hypno and careful play, Nidoking can feasibly work.
However, Nidoking comes with an egregious problem: its typing. Poison and Ground are among the worst possible defensive types in the game, making it weak to the many Water-, Ice-, Ground-, and Psychic-type attacks in the tier, and its Speed only worsens this situation. Therefore, despite its seemingly powerful offensive presence, it can hardly ever switch in because it struggles with so many metagame staples, namely Tentacruel, Hypno, Dragonite, Gyarados, and Articuno. Nidoking also struggles with damage output at many points, causing it to fail to even OHKO Dragonite with Blizzard. Ergo, on competitive RBY UU teams, Nidoking is often passed over in favor of better Ground-types, such as Dugtrio.
Comments: 
Moveset: Mixed Attacker
Description: Thunderbolt allows for Nidoking to hit Water- and Flying-types such as Gyarados, Dewgong, and Articuno. Blizzard 2HKOes Aerodactyl, Dragonite, and Dugtrio, blending with Thunderbolt to give it unresisted coverage. Earthquake gives Nidoking very powerful physical STAB damage, allowing it to 2HKO tier-king Tentacruel and Kadabra, as well as OHKOing Haunter and KOing Electabuzz if it's taken even slight damage. Body Slam lets Nidoking scout for potential switch-ins, potentially paralyzing them and turning the tables.
Nidoking's movepool makes it quite customizable, and, because Earthquake provides most of its necessary coverage, Thunderbolt is the most replaceable. Rock Slide can be used over Thunderbolt to deal up to 63.7% to Articuno while not sacrificing too much against Gyarados and Dewgong, but Nidoking will always lose to Articuno one-on-one if it can't KO it outright, as it's OHKOed by Blizzard. Alternatively, Submission can let Nidoking 2HKO Raticate, as well as 3HKO Persian and Kangaskhan.

Format: NU
Overview: Nidoking is the most diverse threat in RBY NU and boasts several key strengths that differentiate it from other mid-game attackers. Nidoking has the best coverage in the tier and boasts super effective coverage for nearly every foe, as well as STAB Earthquake for powerful neutral damage. Its Electric immunity grants it entry against opposing Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt users, blessing Nidoking with a variety of effective entry points. For example, one's own Mr. Mime or Clefable often baits in and paralyzes their opposing counterpart, after which Nidoking can switch into the predicted Thunder Wave and threaten them heavily. This immunity additionally makes Nidoking a hard counter to Electrode, helping to protect teams from a surprise sweep and exploiting Electrode for free turns. Nidoking can clean up endgames against the tier's various Water-types and Golem due to its superior Speed, 2HKOing Kingler, Kabutops, and Golem before they are able to 2HKO back.
Despite these advantages, Nidoking's typing is a double-edged sword and its Speed leaves it vulnerable to Mr. Mime and Venomoth. Nidoking's Poison typing adds weaknesses to Psychic and Earthquake, making nearly all of Nidoking's matchups risky for both sides, as every top Pokemon in NU has at least one super effective attack against it. Nidoking competes with Golem for a teamslot, in particular missing out on Golem's superior typing. Golem's Rock typing grants it useful Normal and Fire resistances as well as STAB on Rock Slide, whereas Nidoking misses the OHKO against Charizard. Also, Nidoking will leave even victorious fights at low HP, and this is where its imperfect Speed becomes noticeable, as Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and all Fire-types can revenge kill it with ease. Venomoth especially punishes an early Nidoking entry, as it is only 3HKOed by Earthquake, allowing it to switch in, gain massive momentum with Sleep Powder, and then threaten Stun Spore on the switch.
Comments: Other Options
Nidoking's other options all end up surprisingly lacking. Substitute initially looks appealing, but Nidoking's lower bulk means that after using Substitute twice, it is in OHKO range of most of the tier, unlike Golem. Body Slam can potentially paralyze, but this is unreliable and it deals poor damage compared to every other option. Thunder's power allows it to rarely secure 2HKOs that Thunderbolt misses, but the odds are extremely low; its best feat is a 42% chance to 2HKO Seadra after considering accuracy. Overall, the loss in consistency often leaves Nidoking in a far worse position than simply using Thunderbolt. Fire Blast seems like it could cover Venomoth, but it only has a 40% chance to 2HKO and otherwise provides very little. Finally, Submission to hit Clefable is useless, as it has only slightly more power than Earthquake with far worse accuracy. Any of these options create exploitable holes in Nidoking's coverage and should not be considered.
Checks and Counters
Venomoth: Venomoth is perhaps the premier Nidoking check, easily landing sleep in retaliation if Nidoking secures an early-game KO. Venomoth also outspeeds and 3HKOes Nidoking while being one of the few Pokemon to be only 3HKOed back, allowing Venomoth to stop Nidoking even late-game. Nidoking also essentially cannot switch into Venomoth, as Stun Spore leaves it ineffective and Double-Edge often leaves it in range of a Psychic 2HKO.
Mr. Mime: Mr. Mime outspeeds and 2HKOes Nidoking, which can't OHKO back. Mr. Mime cannot switch in, but unparalyzed Mr. Mime easily revenge kills Nidoking and is difficult to switch into itself, shifting the momentum from Nidoking's team with a successful entry. Nidoking should not revenge kill early-game due to the threat of Mr. Mime revenge killing it, even when facing Venomoth-less teams.
Clefable: Clefable is slower than Nidoking, but Blizzard 2HKOes and Nidoking can only 3HKO. Also, Body Slam can paralyze Nidoking as it tries to enter, hamstringing it permanently.
Seadra and Blastoise: Both Seadra and Blastoise are 3HKOed by Thunderbolt while 2HKOing in return. Seadra notably Speed ties Nidoking and can set up Agility to ensure it can use another attack after KOing Nidoking. Blastoise can check Nidoking in a pinch, though its utility as a check to other Pokemon means it will rarely want to take this fight. It also cannot switch in and win, as it is slower than Nidoking.
Faster Pokemon: A number of fast Pokemon can check Nidoking given its propensity for taking heavy damage when trading hits. Charizard and Moltres can switch into Earthquake and outspeed Nidoking, with Moltres even 2HKOing it with Fire Blast. Charizard normally needs mild chip damage or a critical hit in order to win one-on-one, but it can also win with a Fire Spin or two, though this is an uncommon set. Raticate has a 51% chance to 2HKO with Super Fang + Hyper Beam, while Nidoking only has a 23.5% chance to 2HKO with Earthquake, and after a mere 8% chip damage, the 2HKO becomes guaranteed. Ninetales and Fearow can defeat Nidoking after approximately 15-20% chip damage as well.
Moveset: Mixed Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Earthquake is Nidoking's strongest move, particularly against Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Kabutops, as well as an effective midground option to cover most switches. Thunderbolt covers the Water-types of the tier, 3HKOing Blastoise and Seadra and 2HKOing the others, while also dealing decent damage to Charizard or Moltres. Blizzard 2HKOes Golem and Exeggcute while also covering Flying-type switches, acting as a generally safe midground option. Rock Slide provides a 2HKO against Charizard and Moltres, both of which are too bulky for Blizzard or Thunderbolt to 2HKO; Charizard is KOed by either Blizzard or Thunderbolt followed by Rock Slide, while Moltres generally requires two Rock Slides to 2HKO. While the overlapping coverage may seem like overkill, Nidoking can at worst 3HKO every single Pokemon in NU with this set, and the overlapping coverage usually makes it near-impossible to safely switch into Nidoking.
Utilizing Nidoking effectively requires an awareness of how and when to get it into battle, as well as knowing how to utilize midground options to cover switches without giving up KOs. Nidoking can effectively enter battle when opposing Mr. Mime or Clefable is likely to use Thunder Wave or Thunderbolt. As these Pokemon often trade hits with their opposing counterparts, only to be revenge killed after, it is important to set up mismatched situations: for example, getting your own Mr. Mime in on Blastoise to incentivize the opponent to switch their Mr. Mime or Clefable into paralysis. This allows you to switch Nidoking into their retaliatory Thunder Wave. Nidoking can also enter to revenge kill targets such as Water-types, Golem, and Clefable regardless of whether they're paralyzed, especially later in the game when sleep is no longer a concern. Once Nidoking enters battle, the opponent is pressured to either sacrifice their current Pokemon to chip Nidoking or to try to find a relatively safe switch, such as getting Mr. Mime in against a special attack or Charizard in against Earthquake. For example, Nidoking can 2HKO Kabutops with either two Earthquakes or Thunderbolt + Earthquake; the former provides safe entry to Charizard, while Thunderbolt allows Mr. Mime in to force Nidoking out. Knowing Nidoking's KO ranges and the opponent's switch options allows it to heavily punish desperate switches while still securing KOs if the foe stays in.
Nidoking partners well with Mr. Mime, as mentioned, and other paralysis spreaders such as Clefable and Venomoth work the same way. Besides baiting opposing Thunder Wave, they also slow foes down for Nidoking. Exeggcute can also create mismatches by checking Mr. Mime, and it may even paralyze an additional foe as Mr. Mime switches out or use Explosion to grant Nidoking a perfect entry point. It also pairs well with Water-types such as the ubiquitous Blastoise, which baits Electric-type moves late-game and helps to chip down bulkier foes, such as Blastoise and Charizard, for Nidoking to later remove; in return, Nidoking helps to insulate Water-types from a potential Electrode sweep and finish KOs for them. Blastoise and Kingler also often find opportunities to catch switches with Body Slam, potentially paralyzing more opponents.

Format: Stadium OU
Overview: Nidoking manages to find a niche in the Stadium OU metagame as a mixed sweeper thanks to Focus Energy. The move boosts its critical hit rate to a fearsome 62%, which, alongside its perfect coverage and decent attacking stats to back them up, allows it to deal huge damage. In addition, Nidoking has a solid Speed tier that enables it to outpace everything up to Articuno. Its typing isn't entirely without merit, either, as it walls Jolteon and grants it an important immunity to Thunder Wave, a trait that is unique among viable Focus Energy users.
Nidoking has its drawbacks, though. Its horrid defensive typing burdens it with weaknesses to Psychic, Ice, and Ground and leaves it without a resistance to Flying, making it a shakier Zapdos check than Rhydon and Golem. To make matters worse, it's outsped by metagame staples such as Alakazam, Starmie, and Tauros, all of which 2HKO Nidoking. This fragility makes paralysis support a necessity to get the most out of Nidoking. On that note, while Nidoking itself is immune to Thunder Wave, it still hates paralysis and can be crippled by Body Slam or Stun Spore. Additionally, Nidoking is unreliable, as it requires setup and, even after setting up, scoring a critical hit is inconsistent. Nevertheless, with the proper support, it can be an effective addition to a team.
Comments: 
Moveset: Focus Energy Sweeper
Description: Focus Energy significantly boosts Nidoking's critical hit rate, making it very difficult to switch into. Earthquake is Nidoking's most powerful attack; it needs just one critical hit to OHKO Alakazam and 2HKO Starmie and Chansey. Nidoking 2HKOes Tauros and Snorlax as well if it scores two critical hits, but it only has a 38.4% chance to do so. Blizzard is necessary in the third moveslot, as it gives Nidoking the best shot at muscling through Rest Exeggutor before it can retaliate. It has other uses besides this; a critical hit is guaranteed to OHKO Rhydon and Golem and will usually let Nidoking 2HKO Zapdos, and it has a small freeze chance, letting it KO Pokemon it normally would not be able to as a last resort. Finally, with a single critical hit, Thunderbolt 2HKOes Slowbro and OHKOes the rare Cloyster after a little chip damage.
For Nidoking to fulfill its role effectively, it should be kept away from damage and status whenever possible, and faster Pokemon such as Alakazam and Starmie should be paralyzed before it attempts to set up for a sweep. This is easier said than done due to Team Preview, meaning your opponent will know that you have Nidoking on your team and will try to keep these Pokemon as healthy as is feasible so they can keep it in check. Getting Nidoking on the field is not a simple task either due to its horrific defensive typing allowing it to be hit for super effective damage by most metagame staples, but it still has some decent opportunities to switch in and set up with Focus Energy. The most obvious would be the aforementioned Jolteon, which is unable to do anything meaningful to it. Once again, though, your opponent will be aware of Nidoking and will be able to prepare for it by switching out. Another good chance to switch in is on a predicted Rest from Pokemon like Exeggutor. There is also an element of risk here, as most Rest users can predict the switch and deal major damage with their coverage moves, preventing Nidoking from setting up.
Slowbro and Starmie are good partners for Nidoking, as they resist Ice, Psychic, and Water and provide paralysis support for it. Slowbro in particular is adept at drawing in enemy Starmie to paralyze it. In return, Nidoking can protect them from Electric-type moves. Exeggutor is another Pokemon that can spread paralysis, but it differentiates itself from Slowbro and Starmie with a handy resistance to Ground that can make the Rhydon matchup easier.
Thanks to its immense movepool, Nidoking has plenty of room for customization. Substitute can be used in order to protect it from status and critical hits, but it can be difficult to set up alongside Focus Energy, and it puts Nidoking in OHKO range of Rhydon, Alakazam, and Exeggutor. Ice Beam is a more accurate alternative to Blizzard, but it requires an additional critical hit to 2HKO Exeggutor and almost never OHKOes Rhydon and Golem even with a critical hit. Thunder has poor accuracy, but it can be used instead of Thunderbolt; the greater power allows a critical hit to OHKO Cloyster and KO Starmie and Slowbro after minimal chip damage. Body Slam can paralyze switch-ins like Starmie. Rock Slide OHKOes the rare Articuno and Moltres with a critical hit, but Nidoking is OHKOed and 2HKOed by their Blizzard and Fire Blast and requires paralysis support to reliably outspeed them. Surf reliably KOes Rhydon and Golem without needing a critical hit if they are not at full health and has perfect accuracy, but it is inferior to Blizzard otherwise.

Format: PU
Overview: Nidoqueen is a staple of PU and is considered mandatory on the vast majority of teams. Its high bulk, good offensive stats, and phenomenal coverage make it the best progress maker in the tier. Since Nidoqueen can 2HKO the majority of the metagame, getting it onto the field unscathed will almost always force the opponent to sacrifice a Pokemon or risk their switch-in taking massive damage, which usually leads to that switch-in losing anyways. Furthermore, Nidoqueen's immunity to Thunder Wave makes it very difficult to cripple without attacking directly. As a result, Nidoqueen is potent at capitalizing on double switches into slower Pokemon, especially those reliant on paralysis like Drowzee and Dragonair, as Nidoqueen usually beats them one-on-one and dissuades them from switching out. These traits also make it effective at removing paralyzed foes. Additionally, Nidoqueen is an excellent check to some of the tier's best offensive threats; it avoids a 2HKO from Fire Blast users and Pinsir and Scyther's Slash and also isn't KOed by Double Edge + Hyper Beam from Fearow, while it can 2HKO them back with super effective moves.
However, while Nidoqueen's Speed tier defines PU, for this reason teams typically have no shortage of Pokemon that can outspeed it, leading to it being easily revenge killed. Nidoqueen's typing is far from ideal; as great as its Ground typing is, it has weaknesses to common attacks like Surf and Blizzard, while its useless Poison typing gives it weaknesses to Psychic and Earthquake. Nidoqueen's offensive presence isn't flawless either, as it can't 2HKO Porygon, which can heal off the damage with Recover, though it must be wary of critical hits. Despite its immunity to Thunder Wave, every relevant Thunder Wave user can hit it super effectively, limiting the utility of this trait. In spite of its limitations, Nidoqueen's ability to check so much of PU defines team compositions, and every team needs multiple checks to it to be competitive.
Comments: Other Options
Surf OHKOes Graveler, though it has little use elsewhere. Body Slam can fish for paralysis, but Nidoqueen prefers raw damage over an inconsistent paralysis chance. Counter may seem useful for its ability punish foes that use Normal-type attacks, but since Nidoqueen already 2HKOes most foes, it doesn't allow any faster KOs. Nidoqueen's high physical bulk also means Counter will deal less damage compared to other users of the move. However, Counter can punish certain Pokemon after they get a KO, like Fearow, as even when they switch out, Nidoqueen can still use Counter to deal massive damage to the switch-in. Tail Whip can be used to allow Nidoqueen to 2HKO Porygon with Earthquake. While Nidoqueen will likely lose one-on-one if Porygon immediately uses Blizzard, Nidoqueen is favored to win if Porygon uses another move, such as Recover. However, Tail Whip has no use against any other Pokemon in PU, and Porygon can always switch out if it has a teammate that can tank an Earthquake. Initially, Rock Slide may seem like a useful coverage option, but Nidoqueen's Earthquake, Blizzard, and Fire Blast already 2HKO foes that are weak to Rock, leaving it only useful against irrelevant Pokemon like Butterfree. Submission may seem like an option to target Porygon, but it's only marginally stronger than Earthquake with the downsides of terrible accuracy and recoil, and it still fails to 2HKO, rendering it completely useless.
Checks and Counters
Porygon: None of Nidoqueen's attacks 2HKO Porygon, and it can heal off the damage with Recover and threaten Nidoqueen back with Ice-type coverage. However, it must be wary of critical hits, and Porygon loses its ability to consistently check Nidoqueen once paralyzed. Nidoqueen rarely runs Tail Whip, which lets Earthquake 2HKO Porygon, though Porygon is still favored to wint one-on-one when at high health.
Water-types: While it's outsped, Seaking is only 3HKOed by Earthquake and Thunderbolt, and it can 2HKO Nidoqueen with Surf. It can even set up Agility and still win one-on-one. Staryu outspeeds Nidoqueen and can 2HKO with Surf, though Earthquake and Thunderbolt 2HKO back, so Nidoqueen wins if Staryu gets paralyzed.
Burn: Given that Nidoqueen is often tasked with checking Fire-types, it's very susceptible to burns from Fire Blast. Once burned, Nidoqueen is unable to beat them and other foes that it relies on Earthquake to break through, like Omanyte and Drowzee. While these matchups were shaky before, a burned Nidoqueen has no hope of breaking through Porygon and Machamp. If it lacks Thunderbolt, a burned Nidoqueen also has no effective means to make a lasting impact against Staryu, and it struggles to deal significant damage to other Water-types, like Seaking and Slowpoke.
Revenge Killers: Abra outspeeds and 2HKOes Nidoqueen with Psychic, while Nidoqueen only has a 12.8% chance to OHKO back with Earthquake. While they usually lose one-on-one, faster foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, Magmar, Fearow, and Pinsir can outspeed and revenge kill a weakened Nidoqueen. Pinsir is notable as while it loses one-on-one, it can easily switch into Earthquake.
Machamp: Nidoqueen 4HKOes Machamp, while it can 2HKO with Earthquake, forcing a teammate to switch into Machamp's powerful Body Slam or Earthquake. However, due to its lack of recovery, Machamp cannot check Nidoqueen long-term.
Sleep Inducers: Poliwag and Gastly outspeed Nidoqueen and can put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Poliwag can then use Nidoqueen as setup fodder with Amnesia or 2HKO with Hydro Pump, while Gastly can 2HKO Nidoqueen with Psychic. However, their abysmal bulk and reliance on an inaccurate move mean Nidoqueen can get past them with some luck, as it 2HKOes the former and OHKOes the latter. While slower, bulkier sleepers like Vileplume and Weepinbell can easily tank a hit and attempt to put Nidoqueen to sleep with Sleep Powder; Vileplume is notably not 2HKOed by any of Nidoqueen's attacks.
Moveset: The Queen
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
This set gives Nidoqueen perfect coverage, allowing it to deal significant damage to any foe. Earthquake is Nidoqueen's strongest attack against neutral targets, and it's incredibly safe to use, since nothing resists Earthquake without also taking super effective damage from one of Nidoqueen's coverage moves. Additionally, it 2HKOes prominent foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, and opposing Nidoqueen. Blizzard 2HKOes every Flying- and Ground-type besides Nidoqueen itself. Thunderbolt hits Water-types super effectively—it 2HKOes the rare Slowpoke, but it doesn't do significantly more damage than Earthquake to foes like Staryu and Seaking. It's best used to ease prediction, as opponents may try to switch in Fearow or Scyther to take an Earthquake aimed at their Water-type, or if Nidoqueen is burned, as without Thunderbolt it would struggle to damage Water-types. It also helps against the rare Mirror Move Fearow, as a copied Blizzard does significant damage to Nidoqueen. Substitute  eases prediction against foes switching out, and it can exploit attempted sacrifices, which commonly happen once Nidoqueen gets in. However, it's advised not to recklessly use Substitute, as it can cut into Nidoqueen's bulk and make it lose some matchups. For example, setting up a single Substitute leaves Nidoqueen with a 74.2% chance to be 2HKOed by Rapidash and Arcanine's Fire Blast. After losing two Substitutes, it is OHKOed by Nidoqueen's Earthquake. Fire Blast is used to 2HKO Pinsir, which is one the few viable Pokemon that doesn't mind Earthquake or Blizzard. It also lets Nidoqueen fish for burns, which can punish physical attackers like Machamp and Fearow trying to switch in.
Nidoqueen should be used on almost every team. It's often used as a mid-game progress maker, as it's fantastic at breaking down the opponent's defenses, priming a cleaner like Fearow or Seaking for an endgame sweep. While it's rarely a team's best option, it can also check offensive threats like Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, and Scyther. It can switch into them after they get a KO and force them to stay in as it revenge kills them, eliminating a major threat to its team. Thunder Wave users, like Staryu and Drowzee, are the most effective form of support for Nidoqueen; paralysis mitigates Nidoqueen's mediocre Speed and ruins its single consistent long-term check: Porygon. Machamp is another Pokemon that can consistently switch in and beat Nidoqueen, but it lacks recovery and cannot repeatedly switch in. While Nidoqueen isn't helpless against it, a check like Fearow or Pinsir can handle Machamp. Staryu and Seaking pose issues to Nidoqueen thanks to their Water STAB, so checks to them, like Drowzee for the former and one's own Staryu for the latter, work well. Nidoqueen is a strong lead, being among the few Pokemon that can beat Arcanine one-on-one while not being easy to switch into. However, it tends to take significant damage taking on Arcanine, often losing to critical hits or burns.

Overview: Although Nidoqueen sports colorful coverage choices and a valued Electric immunity, it's entirely overshadowed by its cousin Nidoking. This is due to Nidoking's higher Attack and Speed, which enables it to outspeed Kabutops and Blastoise, unlike Nidoqueen. While Nidoqueen does have higher defenses, giving it a better matchup over Pokemon like Raticate and the rare Fearow, this is where its benefits end. It still maintains Nidoking's flaws and fails to offer anything truly unique over it other than those specific matchups. Worse, Nidoqueen's lower Attack stat means that it struggles more to achieve benchmarks Nidoking reaches, like 2HKOing Mr. Mime, 3HKOing Clefable, and 3HKOing Wigglytuff. While Nidoqueen can be run alongside Nidoking, such builds are very niche and tend to be more exploitable.
Comments: 
Moveset: All-Out Attacker
Description: Earthquake 2HKOes Pokemon like Kabutops and Nidoking and functions as Nidoqueen's strongest move in general. Thunderbolt targets Water-types like Blastoise and Kingler while still hitting Flying-types like Moltres and Fearow super effectively. Rock Slide 2HKOes Moltres and Charizard and covers Venomoth. Blizzard 2HKOes Golem and Exeggcute while still maintaining coverage against the aforementioned Flying-types. Nidoqueen's wide movepool includes options like Body Slam, Counter, and Fire Blast, though they are hard to fit over its main moves because Nidoqueen is already strapped for moveslots and needs them to achieve those benchmarks.
Due to Nidoqueen being outclassed by Nidoking, it is best paired alongside it, working together to overwhelm their respective checks and counters. Nidoqueen should ideally be used early- to mid-game as a wallbreaker that enables Nidoking to clean up later on. However, it should be noted that Nidoqueen is limited by its lower Speed in comparison, failing to outpace threats like Blastoise and Kabutops. Much like Nidoking, Nidoqueen would ideally be paired with paralysis spreaders like Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Venomoth. With paralysis support, Nidoqueen can outspeed Pokemon like Kabutops and Mr. Mime. Water-types, like Blastoise and Kingler, can switch into opposing Fire- and Water-type attacks, preserving Nidoqueen's longevity. In turn, they can bait Electric-type attacks and Electrode, giving Nidoqueen safer entry points.

Overview: Ninetales looks decent at first glance with its good Special and average Speed stat, but it nevertheless struggles to make an impact on the RBY UU metagame. Its Speed lets it tie with Tentacruel and to hopefully trap it with Fire Spin, as well as take care of Grass-types such as Venusaur and Tangela. Its fast Fire Spin also lets it pivot well as the move ends, which Pokemon like Persian and Dugtrio love and is useful to switch out against threats like Vaporeon and Dragonite. However, Ninetales is outclassed by other Fire-types, such as Moltres and Rapidash, since it lacks Agility to outpace even other Agility users such as Dragonite and Articuno. Ninetales also lacks coverage options and has a mediocre Attack stat, which makes Body Slam only good for fishing for paralysis. It further has trouble against the Water-type Pokemon that control the tier, such as Vaporeon and Omastar, since they easily switch into Fire-type attacks from it.
Comments: 
Moveset: Fire Spin Pivot
Description: Ninetales can try to paralyze Pokemon that come in on its attacks with Body Slam and then use Fire Spin to accumulate chip damage, or use Fire Blast to finish them off. Fire Blast can 2HKO Dugtrio, Kangaskhan, Articuno, and Venusaur, 3HKO Kadaba, and OHKO Pinsir. It is also useful to try to get a burn, which cripples Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite that try to switch in on Ninetales and physical attackers like Persian and Dodrio. Fire Spin lets Ninetales trap most Pokemon thanks to its high Speed stat and gives it a chance against Dragonite and Tentacruel. Fire Spin also lets Ninetales serve as a pivot. Body Slam is used to spread paralysis, which is especially helpful against Kadabra. Confuse Ray is an option to annoy Wrap users like Tentacruel and Dragonite.

Overview: Omanyte's combination of solid bulk and a Rock / Water typing perfectly counters Rapidash and Arcanine, denying them meaningful progress, and also makes it an effective switch-in to Fearow and Scyther. As these Pokemon are incredibly common offensive threats, Omanyte will almost always have several opportunities to stop a powerful progress-maker in its tracks and then make its own progress. However, while few Pokemon enjoy switching into Omanyte's decently powerful Surf and Blizzard or risking Body Slam paralysis, choosing the wrong move for its switch-in—such as Surf for Seaking or Body Slam for Gastly—leaves it in a bad position. Most of these foes can also switch into Omanyte's attacks at least once and still beat it one-on-one. Omanyte also has an especially hard counter in Porygon, as Omanyte cannot 2HKO or paralyze it while Porygon can heal off the damage with Recover. Omanyte's terrible Speed makes it loses the one-on-one to a variety of metagame threats, such as Nidoqueen and Drowzee, which can force a powerful attack or status condition on one of Omanyte's teammate as it's forced out. Omanyte's low HP also leaves it extremely vulnerable to fixed-damage moves, which 3HKO it. Additionally, its switch-ins are very predictable, making it exploitable with double switching. Pokemon checked by Omanyte have ways to mitigate its effectiveness, as Fearow's sheer power and critical hit rate can quickly wear it down, while Rapidash can use Fire Spin to switch out if its team lacks a decent Omanyte switch-in. Effective use of Omanyte requires a team that can handle its shortcomings and careful management of its HP, and despite walling some top threats, players should consider other options before using Omanyte.
Comments: Other Options
Hydro Pump is much stronger than Surf, notably having around a 47% chance to 2HKO Gastly, a 59% chance to 2HKO Abra, an 83% chance to 2HKO opposing Omanyte, and an 85% chance to OHKO the rare Sandslash, feats Surf can never achieve without a critical hit. Hydro Pump's extra damage against Drowzee leaves it always in range of Machamp's Hyper Beam or two Seismic Tosses, and it gives Rapidash's Hyper Beam and Pinsir's Slash favorable odds to KO Drowzee as well. However, Hydro Pump's poor accuracy makes it quite unreliable, with Surf usually being preferred over its inconsistent counterpart.
Checks and Counters
Porygon: Porygon outspeeds Omanyte, isn't 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard, is immune to Body Slam paralysis, and can heal off damage with Recover, making it Omanyte's worst matchup.
Water-types: While they all dislike paralysis, none of Omanyte's attacks do significant damage to any of the tier's Water-types, whereas they can easily overwhelm it with their STAB moves in return. Staryu can wall Omanyte indefinitely as a result of its access to Recover, while Seaking can set up Agility to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. The rarer Slowpoke and Poliwag can use Omanyte as setup fodder for Amnesia freely.
Gastly: Gastly is uniquely immune to Body Slam while only being 3HKOed by Surf, affording it numerous opportunities to switch in and threaten Omanyte with its higher Speed, Hypnosis, and a 2HKO with Thunderbolt.
Drowzee: Drowzee can outspeed and put Omanyte to sleep with Hypnosis and can usually win the one-on-one with Psychic if sleep isn't available.
Earthquake Users: Machamp outspeeds and 2HKOes Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 3HKOed by Surf in return. While they cannot switch in, Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and the rare Sandslash outspeed and 2HKO Omanyte with Earthquake while only being 2HKOed in return, allowing them to easily win the one-on-one or pick off a weakened Omanyte.
Grass-types: While rare and vulnerable to Blizzard, Weepinbell and Vileplume serve as effective Omanyte checks. Both outspeed it; the former OHKOes Omanyte with Razor Leaf, while the sheer bulk of the latter allows it to reliably 2HKO Omanyte with Mega Drain. Both threats can also put Omanyte to sleep with Sleep Powder.
Moveset: Standard
Description: Set Description
Surf is a decently strong attack that 3HKOes most neutral targets and 2HKOes some notable foes like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Nidoqueen. Blizzard serves as coverage against Fearow, Scyther, Dragonair, and the rare Grass-type such as Vileplume. Body Slam lets Omanyte fish for paralysis on all of its switch-ins barring Gastly and Porygon, allowing Omanyte to still make some progress against Water-types such as Staryu and Seaking. Rest is Omanyte's only form of recovery, but it's unreliable due to the number of turns it leaves Omanyte helpless and thus is best used to secure late-game victories against Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow.
Omanyte partners well with many offensive Pokemon that are outsped by Rapidash, Arcanine, Scyther, and Fearow, such as Pinsir and Machamp. Ironically enough, Rapidash, Arcanine, Scyther, and Fearow also appreciate Omanyte's support, as it secures their mirror matchups and protects Fearow and Arcanine from being revenge killed. In return, these wallbreakers and sweepers can power through defensive Pokemon such as Staryu, Porygon, and Drowzee, which Omanyte can't break past on its own. These threats can also check foes that give Omanyte trouble, such as Machamp handling Nidoqueen and Rapidash handling Pinsir. On the defensive end, Staryu is a great partner for its ability to eternally wall Seaking, which otherwise can use Omanyte as setup fodder. Drowzee, while not as iron-clad, is capable of checking special attackers, such as Gastly, Abra, and Staryu, which give Omanyte trouble. Paralysis support from these Pokemon also goes a long way in helping Omanyte's team break through Porygon for it.

Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Omastar is generally considered less viable in the current metagame. The most up-do-date Omastar set is the following:
Comments: Other Options
Aside from its Rock typing, Seismic Toss is pretty much Omastar's only unique advantage over Vaporeon. It can be fairly useful for its consistent damage against any target. However, most Pokemon are simply hit harder by Omastar’s other moves or more threatened by the chance of paralysis from Body Slam, so the move isn’t overly common or useful. It is strongly advised to stick to the suggested set.
Checks and Counters
Water-type Pokemon: Omastar’s archrival Vaporeon is also one of its most consistent checks. Vaporeon takes very little from all of Omastar’s moves and is relatively unfazed by paralysis. Vaporeon also uses Omastar’s Rock typing against it by scoring a 4HKO with Surf or a 3HKO with Hydro Pump. Poliwrath is in a similar boat, as it shrugs off Omastar’s attacks quite easily and can retaliate with a super effective move like Earthquake or Submission. Finally, while it fears paralysis, Tentacruel easily emerges victorious against Omastar thanks to its access to the strongest unboosted Surf in the tier.
Thunderbolt Users: Electabuzz and Raichu are two of the scariest Pokemon for Omastar to face. While Hydro Pump does quite a lot to both, both dispatch Omastar with relatively uncontested 2HKOs. While it lacks STAB on the move, Gyarados is also more than capable of winning the matchup, even if it switches in. Other users such as Haunter and Persian can't reliably switch in, but they can use their superior Speed to threaten Omastar in a pinch, especially if Omastar has taken a few hits or is asleep.
Earthquake Users: While Omastar is well-equipped to handle Normal- and Flying-type moves, its Rock typing leaves it exposed to Earthquake. Omastar is capable of beating every Earthquake user aside from Poliwrath one-on-one, but the move limits Omastar’s ability to switch in. Earthquake users can also revenge kill Omastar without much damage or paralysis support due to its low Speed. A sleeping Omastar can be exploited rather easily for this same reason. The wrong situation can make Pokemon that Omastar usually matches up well against, like Kangaskhan, Dugtrio, and Golem, suddenly threatening.
Grass-type Pokemon: While rare, Grass-type Pokemon truly threaten Omastar. Venusaur is especially scary, for it outspeeds and claims a clean OHKO with Razor Leaf. Tangela that choose to use Mega Drain can easily 2HKO Omastar while recovering enough health to not be too fearful of Omastar’s Blizzard. Additionally, its Mega Drain begins to enter OHKO territory after just two uses of Growth.

Outdated Analysis
Overview
Omastar first appeared on the RBY UU stage because it was thought to be a strong counter to the then recently-released legendary birds, Articuno and Moltres, as well as the Wrap-happy Dragonite to a lesser extent. However, as the metagame progressed, other significant Pokemon such as Tentacruel and Vaporeon proved more than capable of keeping the birds at bay. As Articuno became less potent and Moltres fell into obscurity, Omastar began to find itself somewhat unemployed. As such, Omastar dwells near the bottom of the RBY UU metagame. It competes quite closely with Vaporeon, which is widely regarded as the tier’s premier bulky Water-type. Despite stiff competition, Omastar has a few attributes that set it apart from Vaporeon and other defensively-oriented Pokemon.
Omastar’s most notable trait is its Rock typing, which makes it a much more specialized defensive unit compared to Vaporeon and the like. It matches up well against Pokemon that rely primarily or exclusively on Normal-, Flying-, or Fire-type moves such as Persian, Dodrio, and Moltres. Omastar is also rivaled only by Haunter and Golem at handling Wrap damage and Explosion. On the negative side, Omastar shares many of the same weaknesses held by other defensive Water-types, such as against Electric-type moves, while acquiring some additional ones. These include a new weakness to Ground-type moves, a worsened weakness to Grass-type moves, and the inability to resist the many Water-type attacks in the tier. Finally, Omastar is remarkably slow, being outpaced by every major Pokemon in the tier aside from Golem. This renders it highly susceptible to being revenge killed.

Description: Set Description
This is the main set you can expect to see Omastar run. It strongly resembles the set most often employed by Vaporeon and seeks to accomplish many of the same goals. Surf or Hydro Pump is its all-purpose STAB move. Both moves hit neutral and weak targets quite effectively thanks to Omastar’s rather high Special stat. Hydro Pump's extra damage is notable for a few targets, such as scoring a 3HKO against Hypno and a guaranteed 2HKO against Kangaskhan and Persian. Surf misses some benchmarks but has higher accuracy and PP. Blizzard grants Omastar coverage resisted only by Water-types. It is also notable for being extremely likely to OHKO Dragonite. It also outperforms Surf and Hydro Pump against a few targets such as Dodrio, Gyarados, and the handful of Grass-types that lurk in the tier. Body Slam is mainly for hitting opposing Water-types. Its most notable target is Tentacruel; should Body Slam paralyze it, it will likely be forced to use Rest and thus become much easier to exploit. Rest is, of course, to keep Omastar healthy, especially against less offensive teams. Successfully using Rest and waking up is quite difficult in the RBY UU environment, but Omastar can occasionally use Rest in front of the Pokemon it can wall and attempt to wake up amidst the many turns of Wrap likely to occur as the match continues.
Omastar is quite good at slowing down your opponent’s offensive momentum. Its Rock typing can be very helpful for pivoting into the many Normal-type moves thrown around in the tier. Omastar can come in rather freely against Persian and Kangaskhan, provided they are using a Normal-type move, and threaten a 2HKO in return. Omastar becomes especially potent if switched in against a Hyper Beam, as it essentially has a free turn to use a powerful special attack. It should be noted that a revealed Omastar is a fairly good deterrent to reckless use of Hyper Beam and Explosion. Additionally, Omastar completely walls Dodrio and Articuno, only fearing the latter freezing it. While it is hardly worth mentioning in the modern metagame because they are so uncommon, Omastar is exceptional at walling Fire-type Pokemon.
Omastar also has interesting interactions with Wrap. It resists the attack, so it is quite good at either PP stalling the attacker or simply taking the hits and hoping to punish a miss. When paired with other Pokemon that take little or no damage from Wrap, like Haunter and Golem, Omastar can feasibly force Tentacruel or Dragonite to exhaust all of their Wrap PP by simply switching in and out with the other Pokemon. Such a strategy can still be exploited by many potential Omastar switch-ins, such as Dugtrio, Electabuzz, and Raichu. This can be overcome with proper prediction; you can pivot into a Pokemon that matches up well against common switch-ins to Omastar. And in end-games where many of these attackers are KOed, Omastar can help secure victories against Pokemon that are dependent on Wrap for damage, such as some variants of Dragonite.
As the tier’s premier Articuno check, Omastar is quite useful on teams that struggle with the legendary bird. Teammates such as Dugtrio, Tangela, and Venusaur most appreciate Omastar's combination of attributes. These three Pokemon also happen to handle Electric-type Pokemon quite well, which threaten Omastar. Flying-type Pokemon like Gyarados, Dragonite, and Dodrio similarly appreciate Omastar’s resistance to Ice while also switching into the Earthquakes that Omastar frequently baits in; these Earthquakes can also help Dodrio safely set up with Agility. While Omastar is a decidedly defensive Pokemon, it is quite good at enabling its offensive teammates, either by giving them a partner into which they can pivot or by spreading paralysis via Body Slam.

Overview: Omastar's typing is almost unique in OU, being shared only with Kabutops. It provides it with useful resistances to Normal and Ice, which allow it to punish Hyper Beam and Explosion, and let it check Snorlax and Tauros lacking Earthquake. This is backed up by its solid bulk and good Special, which enables it to do significant damage with Hydro Pump. Its movepool contains decent utility and coverage options such as Ice Beam, Seismic Toss, Submission, and Body Slam.
Omastar is not recommended for most OU teams, though, as it is plagued by several crippling flaws that outweigh these qualities. It is walled by the omnipresent Chansey and the common Starmie. Slowbro also has little trouble walling it and can use it as an opportunity to set up with Amnesia. Omastar's typing is a double-edged sword that gives it weaknesses to Earthquake and Thunderbolt, which are both common in the metagame. Even if it avoids both, Omastar has to rely on Rest for recovery, which renders it useless for two turns, giving offensive threats such as Tauros and Zapdos opportunities to switch into it and wreak havoc.
Comments: 
Moveset: Tank
Description: STAB Hydro Pump 2HKOes Tauros, allowing Omastar to win against it one-on-one, as Tauros can only 3HKO it with Earthquake or 4HKO with Thunderbolt. Hydro Pump also 3HKOes most other Pokemon that are not named Chansey and do not resist Water. This includes Snorlax, so, even if it is carrying Earthquake, Omastar can still force it out if it switches in on a predicted Snorlax Rest. If Hydro Pump's low PP and 79.7% accuracy are a concern, Surf can be used instead at the cost of a noticeable reduction in power. Ice Beam 3HKOes Exeggutor and Zapdos, and it can also be used to fish for a freeze. Body Slam is used specifically to fish for paralysis on switch-ins like Starmie, though it cannot paralyze Chansey, which also likes to switch into Omastar. Seismic Toss is an alternative option to do consistent damage to Starmie, Slowbro, and Cloyster. Rest restores Omastar to full HP and removes any status it had beforehand. With it, Omastar can loop the rare Amnesia Snorlax that runs Ice Beam as its only move. Unfortunately, Snorlax more commonly runs Blizzard when using Amnesia and 3HKOes Omastar with it at +6.
Omastar has some other options. Blizzard is usable because it 2HKOes Victreebel and requires less prior chip damage than Ice Beam to 2HKO Exeggutor and Zapdos. However, Victreebel is rare, and Blizzard has less PP and accuracy than Ice Beam. Submission 3HKOes Chansey, but it has little other use, causes recoil damage, and only has 79.7% accuracy. Substitute protects Omastar from Ice Beam freezes and paralysis from Body Slam and allows it to burn a Rest turn for free. Reflect and Withdraw boost Omastar's Defense so it can check Snorlax carrying Earthquake, but they do nothing to stop Chansey, Starmie, and Slowbro from walling it. Mimic is unreliable but can get Omastar solid moves from its switch-ins like Thunderbolt, Thunder Wave, and Sing.

Overview: At first glance, Onix's enormous base 160 Defense, Rock typing, and access to useful moves like Bind and Explosion may give the impression that it's usable. After all, it can switch in to stonewall Fearow, a top threat, and fire off attacks. However, Onix is rendered completely unviable by its terrible stats. Having an Attack stat lower than Oddish means that Onix does pitiful damage and struggles to break through anything, even targets that are weak to its STAB moves. Bind is already an unreliable option due to its terrible accuracy, but it suffers further due to Onix's mediocre Speed, which notably leaves it outsped by Nidoqueen. Onix's huge Defense is held back by its atrocious base HP and weakness to Earthquake, which makes it lose to most physical attackers regardless. Its special bulk fares even worse, as its low HP, even worse Special, and weaknesses to Water, Grass, and Ice make it lose to nearly every special attacker in the tier. Notably, Nidoqueen's Blizzard OHKOes it 97.4% of the time. While Onix does stop Fearow in its tracks, it should not be used on any serious team on account of it losing to pretty much every other relevant threat in PU.
Comments: 
Moveset: Bind Pivot
Description: Bind lets Onix pivot out of opposing switch-ins and slower threats. Toxic pairs well with Bind in wearing down foes. Alternatively, Body Slam can be used to spread paralysis. Earthquake is Onix's primary STAB attack, though it's weak due to Onix's terrible Attack stat. Explosion lets Onix sacrifice itself to deal heavy damage to its target, but it should be used sparingly, as it still doesn't OHKO the majority of the tier, and Onix's primary goal is to stay alive to wall Fearow. Onix works best supporting Pokemon that dislike facing Fearow, such as Pinsir and Abra. Checks to Water- and Grass-types, such as Staryu and Drowzee, work well in helping Onix's with its worst matchups. Paralysis support works well to enable Onix's Bind.

Overview: Parasect is the only fully-evolved Pokemon in RBY with access to Spore, giving it the most consistent Double Powder combination in the game. It also has access to Swords Dance to boost its damage output with Hyper Beam, which can be effective with paralysis support from its teammates. Defensively, Parasect has resistances to Ground, Water, and Electric, meaning it can situationally switch in on Pokemon like Machamp, Seaking, and Staryu. Parasect is also generally unfazed by paralysis, making it a decent early-game status absorber. With these strengths, combined with RBY's brutal sleep mechanics, one would be forgiven for thinking Parasect can work in RBY PU.
However, Parasect is entirely outclassed by other sleepers such as Gastly, which has some Speed to back up its Hypnosis, or Drowzee, which has a better typing. This combined with many teams choosing not to use a sleeper at all makes Parasect not worth using. In addition, Parasect's stats are all-around mediocre; its Speed is tied for the lowest among all fully evolved Pokemon. Its terrible typing also makes it very easy to OHKO. This especially applies in RBY PU, a tier filled with powerful Fire-types, such as Rapidash and Arcanine, to prey on its 4x Fire weakness, and other Pokemon like Fearow and Nidoqueen feast on its poor defensive typing as well. Unfortunately, Parasect's positive traits aren't nearly enough to give it a niche in the tier; it should not see use on any serious competitive team.
Comments: 
Moveset: Setup Sleeper
Description: Parasect's game plan is simple: put something to sleep with Spore, then cripple something else with Stun Spore as soon as possible. After this, it can come back late-game when the opposing team is paralyzed and weakened and go on the offensive. Swords Dance reapplies an opposing Pokemon's Speed drop from paralysis, which helps if Parasect has been used to absorb paralysis itself. Hyper Beam is surprisingly powerful at +2, OHKOing Drowzee and Staryu; it can also KO Dragonair, Fearow, and Porygon if they have taken even slight chip damage. Body Slam is a suitable alternative to either of these moves for reliability and the ability to spread more paralysis, letting Parasect serve a more supportive role.
If you must use Parasect, it's best used on teams that hinge on a strong late-game sweeper such as Fearow or Pinsir. Its entire existence hinges on Spore, so the move should never be dropped. While Slash may seem enticing for immediate power, it only lands a critical hit 46.88% of the time because of Parasect’s horrendous Speed, making it unviable. STAB Mega Drain lets Parasect 2HKO Omanyte and Graveler while regaining some HP, but its utility outside of this is questionable. Toxic can be used over Stun Spore to incapacitate partial trapping users such as Dragonair and Rapidash, but whether Parasect gets the opportunity to do this without being KOed or forced out the next turn is another matter.

Overview: Pidgeot is completely outclassed by Fearow, as its better bulk is completely overshadowed by Fearow's higher Attack, Speed, and access to Drill Peck. Pidgeot falls into all the same pitfalls as Fearow, including a losing matchup against Rock-types, a difficult BoltBeam weakness, and a fear of paralysis. The lack of Drill Peck leaves Pidgeot with a much worse matchup against Pinsir and Gastly, which it struggles to threaten. As a result, Pidgeot should never be used on any serious team.
Comments: 
Moveset: Standard
Description: Double-Edge and Hyper Beam serve as powerful STAB attacks coming off of Pidgeot's high Attack, seriously threatening neutral targets such as Staryu, Drowzee, and Dragonair. Sky Attack is Pidgeot's strongest option against Gastly and Pinsir; it has a 64.1% chance to OHKO Gastly, and it also does at least 78.6% to Pinsir. Agility lets Pidgeot boost its Speed and reapply paralysis, notably aiding its role as an endgame cleaner. Alternatively, Toxic lets Pidgeot weaken Rock-types. Mirror Move is also an option in the last slot, potentially letting Pidgeot copy something useful like Earthquake or Swords Dance.
Since Pidgeot is outclassed, it can only be justified if brought alongside Fearow. They share Rock-type counters like Omanyte and Graveler, so Porygon is a mandatory partner. Rapidash and Arcanine also give this duo trouble, so Omanyte works well in countering them. Given that Gastly easily switches into Pidgeot and forces it to use Sky Attack, checks to it like Drowzee and Abra are essential. Pidgeot hates being paralyzed, so it's best used either as an endgame cleaner, when all opposing paralysis spreaders have been weakened or KOed, or as a midgame wallbreaker, willing to sacrifice itself to aid another cleaner.

Format: PU
Overview: Pinsir's gargantuan Attack stat and Slash makes it among PU's most powerful wallbreakers. Slash at minimum 3HKOes every neutral target and 2HKOes some notable foes like Drowzee and Staryu. Thanks to its access to Seismic Toss and Submission, Pinsir lacks any true walls, unlike other offensive threats like Fearow and Seaking. Once on the field, it is an instantly threatening force that virtually no foe can safely switch into; even Pokemon that can switch into Slash and win one-on-one, like Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine, hate having to take so much damage from Pinsir's Slash. Pinsir is also among the few Pokemon in PU that can 2HKO Porygon without a critical hit thanks to Submission. Pinsir's Speed is also quite good, only being outsped by Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, and the rare Abra and Magmar. Tying with Staryu, it outspeeds every other viable Pokemon, which includes important foes like Nidoqueen, Drowzee, and Porygon.
However, Pinsir struggles in a metagame so hostile to it. Pinsir's typing leaves a lot to be desired, as its good physical bulk and useful Ground resistance are overshadowed by its terrible weaknesses to Fire and Flying. Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow all outspeed it and beat it one-on-one, with the former two able to outright OHKO it. Even Pinsir's one good resistance is shaky, as many Earthquake users, like Nidoqueen and Graveler, carry super effective STAB moves or coverage moves that can 2HKO it. Pinsir's main niche as an unwallable wallbreaker is less effective than it would seem at first glance. While all three of Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow are walled by Omanyte, and Fearow is walled by Graveler, both Rock-types are themselves walled by Porygon, making those poor matchups almost unpunishable. Pinsir is itself reliant on Rock-types to not get easily revenge killed by the aforementioned trio, so it's often a liability. Additionally, while Pinsir does have the tools to threaten every Pokemon in the metagame, the moves it relies on to target Gastly and Rock-types can only 3HKO them and most other targets, making it possible to pivot in a check to Pinsir with good prediction. Pinsir's plethora of poor matchups makes it hard to justify on teams when one could simply use another offensive threat that requires less support, though its impact on the metagame canot be ignored when a near mandatory Pokemon, Nidoqueen, often carries Fire Blast solely for it.
Comments: Other Options
Body Slam can be used to spread paralysis, but Pinsir generally makes more progress using its standard set. Swords Dance is an enticing option, as the sheer power of a boosted Hyper Beam can OHKO nearly every non-Rock- or Ghost-type, KOing even extremely bulky neutral targets like Arcanine and Nidoqueen after the slightest chip damage. Additionally, a +2 Hyper Beam has a 71.8% chance to OHKO Porygon, and a +2 Submission will always do so. Pinsir can notably take advantage of Porygon to set up, as while it risks taking Thunder Wave, few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's boosted attacks. However, using Swords Dance and Hyper Beam means Pinsir must give up Bind and one of its coverage moves, leaving it unable to threaten certain foes. Pinsir being so easy to force out is another factor that limits the utility of Swords Dance, as it's extremely easy to revenge kill and foes like Rapidash and Arcanine can switch into it as it uses the move.

Fire Blast Users: Rapidash and Arcanine outspeed Pinsir and have a 79.5% chance to OHKO it with Fire Blast, while its Slash only rarely 2HKOes Rapidash and 3HKOes Arcanine. Magmar is almost always 2HKOed by Slash, but it outspeeds and OHKOes Pinsir with its Fire Blast. Nidoqueen 2HKOes Pinsir with Fire Blast, while Slash only 3HKOes back, but Nidoqueen being slower means it needs to be in pristine condition and possibly deal with Bind to win one-on-one.
Fearow: Fearow outspeeds Pinsir and has a 96.8% chance to 2HKO with Drill Peck, while Slash only has a 30.7% chance to 2HKO back. However, it is a tenuous check, since it can generally only switch into Pinsir once.
Gastly: Seismic Toss only 3HKOes Gastly, and it is immune to all of Pinsir's other moves, so it can effortlessly switch in and put Pinsir to sleep with Hypnosis. However, once Sleep Clause is active, Gastly loses one-on-one and will usually need to pivot into in a faster threat, which is predictable.
Rock-types: Pinsir's Submission only 3HKOes Graveler, and its Rock Slide has an 87.6% chance to 2HKO back, which becomes 100% after Submission's recoil. Omanyte loses one-on-one, but it can easily force Pinsir to use Submission or Seismic Toss, allowing it to pivot in a faster threat.
Paralysis: Once paralyzed by threats such as Staryu and Drowzee, Pinsir is easy to overwhelm. Threats that normally lose due to being outsped, such as Seaking and Omanyte, now easily beat Pinsir. Dragonair can also use Wrap to bring Pinsir into KO range. Tenuous checks to Pinsir, such as Nidoqueen, Machamp, and Graveler, find themselves more comfortably able to overwhelm it.
Moveset: All-Out Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Slash is Pinsir's most spammable attack, 2HKOing or 3HKOing most foes. Submission is Pinsir's strongest attack against Porygon, Omanyte, and Graveler, 2HKOing the former two and 3HKOing the latter. Seismic Toss hits Gastly, which is immune to all of Pinsir's other moves. Seismic Toss also lets Pinsir cover switches, as it still deals decent damage to Rock-types, notably 3HKOing Omanyte. It also puts many targets that are 3HKOed by Slash in 2HKO range, such as Machamp and Nidoqueen, and puts Staryu in OHKO range. Bind allows Pinsir to chip foes into KO range and pivot around slower threats. However, given its terrible accuracy, Bind should only be used when necessary.
Pinsir can be used as a wallbreaker or a cleaner for its team. When used as a wallbreaker, it's excellent at removing or weakening crucial defensive pieces such as Porygon, Drowzee, and Staryu. This helps speedy offensive threats, such as Rapidash and Fearow, in sweeping late-game. While Pinsir loses one-on-one against Nidoqueen at full health, in a pinch it can switch into Earthquake and tank one Fire Blast, letting it land Slash twice to leave its foe easy to revenge kill. If used as a cleaner, it enjoys the support of wallbreakers such as Nidoqueen and Fearow to weaken defensive Pokemon. Thunder Wave support from teammates such as Staryu, Porygon, and Drowzee is crucial to pave the way for Pinsir's sweep. Pinsir need to be unparalyzed for it to clean, making allies that can switch into Thunder Wave, like Drowzee and Nidoqueen, good partners. Pinsir is easily handled by Rapidash, Arcanine, and Fearow, which outspeed and threaten it with their STAB attacks. Therefore, Omanyte and Graveler are essential for preventing Pinsir from being easily revenge killed. Pinsir struggles against Rock-types and Gastly, which force it to use its weak coverage moves. Thus, Water-types such as Seaking and Staryu for the former, and Psychic-types such as Abra and Drowzee for the latter, are appreciated. Porygon walls Rock-types, at best Graveler can trade using Explosion, making it a good teammate.

Format: OU
Overview: Pinsir is the sole viable Bug-type in RBY OU thanks to an amazing Attack stat that can be further boosted by Swords Dance, allowing it to let loose nuclear Hyper Beams while trapping with Bind. A +2 Pinsir is nothing to be trifled with, capable of beating Snorlax outright with Submission and possessing a Hyper Beam that can OHKO the physically frailer Pokemon in the tier, including Jolteon, Chansey, Jynx, Alakazam, and Victreebel. Additionally, Pinsir has the strongest non-STAB Slash in the game, hitting nearly as hard as Persian right out of the gate. This makes it one of the few physical attackers that can contest Reflect users like Snorlax and Chansey, the latter of which it can 2HKO. Pinsir's typing gives it surprising defensive utility as well, resisting Earthquake and not being hit super effectively by Thunderbolt, giving it use over other Swords Dance users like Kingler. Pinsir is by no means slow relative to OU either, outpacing Victreebel and Cloyster, and, with paralysis support, it can absolutely mow down even the faster Pokemon in the tier, acting as a surprisingly strong late-game sweeper.
However, like all RBY Bug-types, Pinsir suffers from some severe downsides. While powerful, Pinsir cannot hit Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing strictly Normal- and Fighting-type attacks in its offensive movepool. Ergo, Gengar can effortlessly switch in and let out a completely uncontested Hypnosis while Pinsir is forced to switch out or pivot out with Bind. Pinsir also suffers from a bit of four moveslot syndrome, demanding Swords Dance and Hyper Beam while having to pick between Slash, Submission, and Bind for its last two slots, all of which can significantly affect its matchups. Worse still, Pinsir is very reliant on its Speed to sweep, as being outsped exposes its noticeably mediocre special bulk, leading to it getting forced out by paralysis inducers such as Alakazam, Starmie, and full HP Chansey. These flaws make Pinsir a rare sight in RBY OU, but a serviceable pick nonetheless.
Comments: Other Options
While a highly contested slot, Pinsir's fourth moveslot is the most flexible. If a team absolutely needs another Pokemon to hit Gengar, Seismic Toss is a suitable option, allowing Pinsir to punish its attempts to switch in. After two strikes, Gengar often becomes much more inclined to Explode, making it a bit more predictable. However, fitting Seismic Toss always brings severe opportunity cost, causing Pinsir to lose out on Submission's fantastic damage against Normal-types or Bind's utility.
Checks and Counters
Gengar: Pinsir can't even touch Gengar without Seismic Toss, possessing no alternatives to hit it. Worse still, Gengar's Thunderbolt is a guaranteed 3HKO, dealing up to 41.4% per hit, or it can fire off a completely uncontested Hypnosis. However, Bind can immobilize Gengar while allowing Pinsir to bring in a teammate such as Alakazam for free, which does add a degree of risk.
Paralysis: Paralysis rains on Pinsir's parade, exposing its severely lacking special bulk and making it near-incapable of running over the opposing team. There is counterplay if Pinsir's foe is paralyzed as well, though, as Pinsir can attempt to use Swords Dance to reapply the Speed drop and continue whaling on them. Pokemon like Exeggutor and Lapras become much more threatening when Pinsir is paralyzed, utilizing their powerful special attacks to 2HKO it. As a result, Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will often force Pinsir out by the threat of paralysis alone unless it's in a situation where paralysis doesn't matter. This also makes Body Slam paralysis from Pokemon like Tauros, Snorlax, and Rhydon particularly annoying, as Pinsir can't often stomach more than two hits from any given Pokemon.
Strong Special Attackers: Pinsir's special bulk of 65/55 is awful; even Jolteon's Thunderbolt and Starmie's Surf have a high chance to 2HKO it. As a result, Pinsir is very frequently forced out by special attackers unless it can KO them first, such as if they're paralyzed or chipped. However, Pinsir does often have the chance to attack them once, which can situationally be all it needs in endgame scenarios.
Physically Bulky Foes: Pokemon like Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro put large amounts of pressure on Pinsir—especially if it's paralyzed—while being able to stomach its hefty physical blows. These Pokemon can also strike back with equally devastating attacks; in Rhydon's case, Rock Slide can deal upwards of 80% in a single hit, which can be a KO if Pinsir even tries to respond with Submission.
Counter Users: If Pinsir can't KO Chansey outright, Counter Chansey will OHKO Pinsir if it uses any of its offensive attacks bar Bind. This can also apply to more niche Counter users, such as Snorlax, Alakazam, and Kangaskhan. However, if Pinsir has Bind, it has a solid way to counter-play the strategy, immobilizing the Counter users and chipping them into Hyper Beam range.
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Set Description
Swords Dance and Hyper Beam are Pinsir's bread and butter, allowing it to swiftly end games if its team can successfully chip and paralyze the opposing team. It should be noted that Swords Dance reapplies the paralysis Speed drop to paralyzed foes, so if Pinsir itself is paralyzed, it isn't game over just yet. This effect also applies to paralyzed Pokemon attempting to switch in, making doing so extremely risky.
Pinsir's last two moveslots largely depend on what its user wants. For the third moveslot, Slash gives Pinsir immediate power and provides a better matchup against Reflect users, while Body Slam lets Pinsir spread its own paralysis, making it more self-sufficient. For the fourth slot, Submission, while unreliable and giving Pinsir significant blowback for its use, is an amazing way to dispatch Cloyster, Chansey, and Snorlax at +2, dealing well over 50% to each of them. In fact, after two boosts, Pinsir can outright OHKO non-Reflect Snorlax. Alternatively, Bind can occupy either the third or fourth moveslot, letting Pinsir pivot into its teammates to gain a better position while also dealing serious chip damage. This works especially well against paralyzed teams, forcing them to switch around to PP stall it while often taking around 7% each time if Pinsir has picked up even a single boost, which rapidly adds up over the course of the move.
While this is all well and good on paper, using Pinsir in practice is fairly difficult. It's best to keep it to endgame scenarios, when the opposing team has likely been thoroughly paralyzed. However, it's perfectly fair to switch it in on a Chansey's Soft-Boiled turn or a Snorlax's Rest or Earthquake, both options that Pinsir doesn't really care about. Similarly, Recover turns from paralyzed Alakazam and Starmie are good opportunities for Pinsir to sneak in and force damage on the opposing team; if either of these Pokemon experience full paralysis when attempting to respond, they could absolutely be KOed the following turn. Fellow partial trapping pivots and Explosions are other good switch-in chances. Picking up a boost with Pinsir is also quite difficult, though Pinsir is not against taking a hit to set up if it means winning the game there and then. Punishing a Snorlax Rest with Pinsir is among the best ways to get a boost with impunity, often forcing Snorlax out lest it is KOed from there. Pinsir works best on teams that have multiple paralysis inducers, one of which will likely be the ubiquitous Chansey. Jolteon synergizes very well with Pinsir, appreciating Pinsir's Ground resistance and ability to 2HKO Rhydon with +2 Submission.

Format: UU
Overview: Pinsir has a unique place in RBY UU thanks to its access to Bind, decent Speed, and potentially massive damage output by virtue of Slash and Swords Dance. Its Bug typing provides it with a resistance to Earthquake; this makes it work well alongside Tentacruel and Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu, especially when checking Dugtrio for them. Pinsir's biggest selling point, however, is its sheer threat level should it boost with Swords Dance, which allows it to flatten paralyzed teams. Few Pokemon can switch into Pinsir's +2 Hyper Beam; some standout calculations include a 41% chance to OHKO Tentacruel and a 2.6% chance to OHKO Hypno. This makes Pinsir a particularly brutal punishment for Pokemon that are often forced to use Rest, such as Vaporeon and Hypno. While not perfect, Pinsir's Speed lets it outpace Dragonite and Hypno, which makes it great at revenge killing them. Further, having a partial trapping move faster than Dragonite can be crucial in many situations, allowing Pinsir to keep Dragonite from setting up with Agility and switch to a counter, such as Tentacruel, for free. Bind allows Pinsir to form a partial trapping core alongside Tentacruel and Dragonite as well, providing teams with significant momentum, especially if the opposing team is stricken with paralysis.
As with almost any Bug-type in RBY, though, Pinsir is held back by some severe flaws. Pinsir has no STAB attacks to speak of and is forced to rely only on Normal- and Fighting-type moves. It thus competes with the Normal-type attackers of the metagame—Persian, Dodrio, and Kangaskhan—for a place on teams. Pinsir's Normal and Fighting reliance also makes it completely invalidated by Haunter, which forces it to switch or pivot out with Bind. It also struggles with Rock-types if it lacks Submission, and its weakness to Rock Slide doesn't help there. While Pinsir's Speed helps in some minor ways, it just isn't good enough: Pinsir is outpaced by common threats like Tentacruel, Dodrio and Kadabra, which are very capable of threatening it due to its mediocre typing or low Special. As a result, Pinsir relies heavily on teams that spread paralysis efficiently, making it somewhat dependent on the player's Hypno to function well. These flaws are only worsened by it being debilitated by paralysis and mandating setup, which can be very difficult to accomplish in the Wrap-infested format. Paralysis isn't the only status to give Pinsir trouble either, as Toxic—a substantially common way to deal with Dragonite—puts a firm cap on Pinsir's use of Bind, causing it to take more damage than it would normally deal, which is only made worse by Bind's inherent inconsistency. Overall, Pinsir has some very strong points in its favor, but it's a high-risk pick that necessitates a team built around it as well as a competent player.
Comments: Other Options
Body Slam can allow Pinsir to be more self-sufficient in the paralysis department while denying switches in from faster threats. However, Slash's damage is sorely missed in this case, causing Pinsir to miss out on many potential KOs and become more reliant on Swords Dance. Seismic Toss can be utilized, as it's Pinsir's sole option to hit Haunter, but it does little to help the matchup; switching out or pivoting with Bind is really all Pinsir can do. Toxic can be helpful for dealing with Dragonite, which otherwise uses Pinsir as setup fodder. However, Pinsir doesn't necessarily need Toxic, as it can use Bind to safely bring in a counter, such as Tentacruel.
Bind can be cut for moveslot flexibility, but this causes Pinsir to be a severe momentum sink mid-game. Should the opponent reveal Haunter or a Rock-type, Pinsir is forced out and has to have a teammate take a hit for it, which can let the opponent open holes. Switching out with Bind ensures momentum isn't lost, as foes are unable to move, even Haunter. However, with Bind cut, Pinsir becomes more consistent late-game, as it's less reliant on Bind's shaky accuracy.
Checks and Counters
Haunter: Pinsir can't touch Haunter at all without the largely undesirable Seismic Toss. To make matters worse, Haunter is faster and gets a near-guaranteed 3HKO with Thunderbolt. As such, Pinsir is normally forced to switch out through a manual switch or Bind. It should be noted that Bind still immobilizes Haunter, allowing Pinsir to safely bring in a counter like Dugtrio, so using Bind to catch Haunter switching in is viable counterplay.
Rock-types: If Pinsir doesn't run Submission, it's forced out by Rock-types. However, if it does, it usually 2HKOes them at +2, albeit with significant recoil damage and questionable reliability. Golem is adept at coming in on Hyper Beam and outright 2HKOes Pinsir with Rock Slide, meaning it wins in this situation even if Pinsir has boosted. Omastar deals up to 72% with Hydro Pump, which can be followed up with Blizzard to dispatch Pinsir. In addition, considering Submission recoil, Omastar can easily 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. Aerodactyl is another particularly solid counter, only facing a near-guaranteed 4HKO from Submission while 2HKOing in return with Fire Blast.
Strong Special Attackers: Pinsir's special bulk is very poor, so threats like Articuno and Kadabra 2HKO it with their STAB moves. However, these matchups are volatile if Pinsir is at full health. Pinsir Speed ties with Articuno and therefore can potentially win if it's boosted; Slash + Hyper Beam will 2HKO Articuno quite frequently. Against Kadabra, Pinsir can deal up to 91% with Slash alone, and +2 Hyper Beam will always OHKO it unless there's an unfortunate miss. As such, Kadabra is restricted to revenge killing Pinsir, which can be stifled by teammates like Hypno, though Pinsir being forced out isn't necessarily ideal. While they are very rare, Fire-type Pokemon like Moltres greatly threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast.
Tentacruel: Tentacruel is faster than Pinsir, can pivot out of bothersome situations through Wrap, and heals paralysis with Rest. It's very difficult for Pinsir to set up in games due to the existence of Tentacruel's Wrap, constantly delaying it while chipping Pinsir into KO range. On top of this, Tentacruel is near-guaranteed to 2HKO Pinsir with Surf. However, Pinsir is very capable of exploiting paralyzed Tentacruel, possessing a potential OHKO with +2 Hyper Beam. If Pinsir paralyzes Tentacruel with Body Slam on the switch, Tentacruel is liable to outright lose. Overall, though, this matchup is very unfavorable and using Pinsir against a healthy Tentacruel is strongly discouraged.
Dodrio: Dodrio can revenge kill Pinsir with Drill Peck, 2HKOing it. It can't switch in to save its life though, taking massive damage from Slash, which has a small but notable chance to 2HKO; alternatively, Slash + Hyper Beam is a guaranteed 2HKO. Furthermore, if Pinsir has boosted, it can OHKO Dodrio with Hyper Beam 89.7% of the time. Dodrio can't fight Pinsir at all if it's paralyzed.
Moveset: Swords Dance Sweeper
Description: Set Description
The premise of the set is simple: set up with Swords Dance and put 'em away. Hyper Beam is Pinsir's claim to fame, KOing Pokemon from around half HP even without setup and becoming an OHKO machine if boosted. Slash gives Pinsir immediate and significant power, but Submission—albeit somewhat inconsistently—allows Pinsir to beat Rock-types that try to switch in on Hyper Beam, as well as deal massive damage to Persian and Kangaskhan. Finally, Bind allows Pinsir to provide its team with momentum while chipping threats into Hyper Beam KO range, which becomes near-effortless against paralyzed teams. When boosted by Swords Dance, Bind can be surprisingly powerful; for example, it can deal up to 10.4% to Hypno per hit, quickly bringing it into KO range.
Pinsir can be a fairly unwieldy Pokemon to use, relying on a paralyzed team to sweep reliably. However, it has multiple points of entry, particularly Dugtrio, which it can beat outright, 2HKOing it with Slash and only being 3HKOed by Rock Slide 0.1% of the time. Outside of this, Pinsir can punish paralyzed Pokemon heavily, be it by revenge killing them or switching in on their physical attacks, which is made safer by the potential for full paralysis. Paralysis further benefits Pinsir's Bind, giving it a safety net for its more frequent misses than Wrap. Pinsir is capable of exploiting Pokemon using Rest quite well with Swords Dance, which can potentially mean an outright win depending on the game state. Pinsir fits on teams that appreciate its Ground resistance and physical attacking prowess. This particularly applies to those looking to get the most mileage out of Tentacruel and Electric-types, so long as the team is capable of providing extensive paralysis support in return.

Format: NU
Overview: Pinsir is a frightening Swords Dance sweeper in RBY NU, possessing one of the highest power levels in the tier in the tier alongside Bind and Slash. Once set up, Pinsir goes on a rampage, quickly chipping down Pokemon with Bind before letting loose one of the strongest Hyper Beams in the game. Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Dragonair, Venomoth, Exeggcute, and Poliwhirl are even threatened with outright OHKOs at +2, while Blastoise and Clefable need minimal Bind chip damage to OHKO as well. Pinsir is by no means slow either, tying Nidoking and Seadra and getting the jump on Blastoise and Kabutops. When forming a core with wrappers such as Rapidash, Moltres, and Charizard, Pinsir can add some much-needed physical attacking prowess. With paralysis support from the likes of Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Porygon, Pinsir can also sweep past otherwise faster checks like Charizard and Moltres.
However, Pinsir's movepool is extremely shallow, making it linear and open to very simple counterplay, such as switching in Golem or even just having Counter. With the high viability of Fire-types in RBY NU, Pinsir's low Special also comes back to haunt it, leaving it OHKOed by even Charizard's Fire Blast and limiting setup opportunities against special attackers like Seadra. This special frailty means Pinsir is best used on teams populated by Water-types such as Blastoise and Kabutops, the latter with which actually competes heavily with it. That competition further extends to Kingler, which possesses similar qualities to Pinsir while having reliable counterplay to Rock-types in Crabhammer, as well as other Pokemon like Sandslash. However, it fares well alongside these Swords Dance users, and Bind can be enough for it to distinguish itself over them. Worse still, Pinsir's Speed, while good, is still not quite desirable; Fire-types revenge kill it, as do Venomoth, Fearow, and tier-king Mr. Mime. Its suboptimal Speed also makes paralysis even worse, exposing its fragility and making it very difficult to clean up even paralyzed teams. Regardless, Pinsir functions as an effective wallbreaker or sweeper, supporting top-tier Pokemon like Charizard very well in the metagame.
Comments: Other Options
Pinsir can drop Bind for more offensive flexibility, but this makes it more of a momentum sink, forcing Pinsir to manually switch out against slower Pokemon if threatened with paralysis or heavy damage. Ergo, many teams have to use a deliberate game plan centered around strictly late-game usage for these sets to work. However, sets like Swords Dance / Hyper Beam / Body Slam / Submission provide Pinsir with alternative midground options once successfully switched in, more effectively contesting common switch-ins like Golem and Charizard.
In terms of niche move choices, Pinsir has few that are justifiable because of its terrible movepool. Toxic is feasible for incapacitating Fire Spin users as they switch in, such as Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres, but Body Slam is normally enough of a deterrent. However, it does come with the added bonus of piling chip damage on Rock-types when used alongside Bind. Seismic Toss is all Pinsir can muster for the very rare Gastly, but Bind can at least secure a safe pivot, and Seismic Toss is rarely helpful.
Checks and Counters
Fire-types: All Fire-types in RBY NU, with the exception of Flareon, outspeed and mortally threaten Pinsir with Fire Blast and Fire Spin, namely Charizard, Ninetales, Rapidash, Arcanine, Moltres, and the rare Magmar. Even if Pinsir survives a Fire Blast from Rapidash or Magmar, it is still at risk of being burned and instantly fainting. However, if the Fire-types are paralyzed, Pinsir poses a serious threat, as a +2 Hyper Beam will KO any of them if they have taken minor damage prior.
Rock-types: If Pinsir lacks Submission, it can hardly scratch Rock-types like Golem and Kabutops, immediately losing momentum and having to pivot with Bind. If it does have Submission, however, Pinsir is capable of dealing massive damage, 2HKOing them at +2.
Paralysis: Pinsir needs foe paralysis to outspeed the faster threats of RBY NU and therefore despises taking it itself; ergo, faster paralysis users such as tier-king Mr. MIme, Venomoth, Electrode, and the rare Abra can force Pinsir out after it gets a KO. Clefable, Wigglytuff, and Porygon are also capable of absorbing hits from an unboosted Pinsir and paralyzing it in return. Body Slam is also common on a myriad of Pokemon, most commonly Clefable, Wigglytuff, Kingler, and some Blastoise variants, which can pose further risk. While Pinsir can threaten Clefable and Wigglytuff with Submission, it will take high recoil damage in the process, with the latter costing around a third of its health at +2. While Swords Dance can reapply the paralysis Speed drop on foes to help if Pinsir has been paralyzed, this is unreliable and leaves it open to attack.
Counter Users: Pinsir is the sole fully-evolved Pokemon that has no damaging moves that can circumvent Counter. This means that Pokemon such as Charizard, Blastoise, Poliwhirl, Clefable, and Wigglytuff can all pose a mortal risk to Pinsir by existing. This also makes Hyper Beam use somewhat risky, as a Counter user can switch in, stomach the hit, and hit Pinsir with Counter next turn for the KO. Pinsir can use Bind to bring Counter users down to Hyper Beam range and KO them, but this isn't always mathematically probable. Using Swords Dance to bait out an early Counter and KO the following turn is also possible, but very risky, especially against paralysis users Clefable and Wigglytuff. Consequently, Pinsir teams must scout for Counter early into a game.
Gastly: While rare, Gastly completely walls Pinsir. To even damage it, Pinsir requires Seismic Toss, which it cannot afford, and the only other attack that has any effect is Bind, which doesn't damage it but allows Pinsir to pivot into a check safely. In turn, Gastly can use Hypnosis uncontested or 4HKO Pinsir with Thunderbolt.
Moveset: Swords Dance + Bind
Description: Swords Dance is Pinsir's claim to fame, allowing it to rapidly chip down teams with Bind before blasting them away with Hyper Beam. Swords Dance also ensures paralysis doesn't immediately ruin Pinsir, allowing it to reapply a foe's paralysis Speed drop and keep the momentum in its favor. For example, against a paralyzed Mr. Mime—a common sight after Mr. Mime have a mirror match—Pinsir can enter and set up, remaining faster despite Thunder Wave, and OHKO Mr. Mime with Hyper Beam the next turn. Pinsir's third moveslot is flexible; Slash provides immediate power for safer revenge killing than Hyper Beam, while the weaker Body Slam makes Pinsir more self-sufficient, spreading paralysis and being boosted by Swords Dance. Body Slam also strongly deters Fire Spin users such as Ninetales and Charizard, which otherwise switch in on Pinsir easily. Finally, Submission OHKOes Porygon and 2HKOes Kabutops and Golem at +2, which Pinsir otherwise struggles to break through, although the steep drop in consistency is a pain for it to deal with.
Pinsir functions best late-game when it's not at risk of being paralyzed during its sweep. It's also strongly recommended to paralyze Fire-types like Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres with teammates like Mr. Mime and Clefable; otherwise, Pinsir is easily revenge killed. Kabutops checks Charizard and can KO it outright while quadruply resisting Fire Spin, and it forms a strong physical attacking core with Pinsir that has decent defensive integrity. If not running Submission, Golem and Kabutops should also be removed, with Water-types like Blastoise being great against the former, as Pinsir has issues breaking through them. Pinsir can find switch-in opportunities against Rest users like Blastoise with Rest giving free turns for Pinsir to set up. Outside of this, Pinsir is a great switch-in to Earthquake from the likes of Pokemon like Nidoking; in this case, it can Speed tie Nidoking and either deal serious damage with Slash or gain momentum with Bind. Pinsir works well with fellow wrappers such as Charizard, sometimes alongside other Fire-types like Ninetales, as Pinsir can threaten Golem with Submission while having a wrapping move itself and a Ground resistance for pivoting.

Overview: Poliwag's blistering base 90 Speed and access to Hypnosis make it the fastest sleeper in the tier. Once it puts something to sleep, it can turn into a dangerous sweeper thanks to Amnesia. However, Poliwag's awful bulk leaves it completely reliant on landing Hypnosis to find any opportunities to set up, rendering it horribly inconsistent. To make matters worse, Poliwag struggles to OHKO targets weak to its Surf at +2, incentivizing further inconsistency by using Hydro Pump to reach these crucial damage rolls. Its Speed, while great, is still worse than several common threats, such as Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine. When choosing a sleeper, teams usually prefer the better offensive and defensive utility from Gastly and Drowzee, and Seaking is usually preferred as a Water-type setup sweeper. Thus, Poliwag should be used with extreme caution due to its reward often being lower than its risk.
Comments: Other Options
Blizzard can be used over Psychic, exchanging the ability to break through Water-types and fish for Special drops to instead hit Fearow and Dragonair for super effective damage and reach higher damage ranges against Grass-types. However, even at +2 Blizzard fails to OHKO Fearow and Dragonair, and Fearow is 2HKOed by +2 Surf anyway.
Checks and Counters
Fearow: Fearow outspeeds Poliwag and has a 33.3% chance to OHKO it using Hyper Beam, while it can't even OHKO Fearow with +2 Hydro Pump or Blizzard.
Water-types: Barring Special drops, Seaking isn't even 3HKOed by +2 Psychic, and it can KO Poliwag with a combination of Double-Edge and Hyper Beam. Staryu struggles to deal damage to a boosted Poliwag without critical hits and is 3HKOed by +2 Psychic, but it can cripple Poliwag with Thunder Wave. While rare, Slowpoke resists all of Poliwag's attacks, can paralyze it with Thunder Wave, and can use it as setup fodder for its own Amnesia. However, given that they're all slower, these threats must watch out for Hypnosis.
Fire-types: Arcanine can outspeed and 2HKO Poliwag with Body Slam and Hyper Beam, though a +2 Hydro Pump has a 66.7% chance to OHKO it. While +2 Hydro Pump always OHKOes them, Rapidash and Magmar can also outspeed and KO Poliwag using a combination of Body Slam and Hyper Beam. Besides winning the one-on-one, all of these Fire-types can easily revenge kill a weakened Poliwag. However, these Pokemon struggle to switch in due to their weakness to Water.
Weepinbell: Though rare, Weepinbell can easily tank a +2 Psychic or Blizzard and OHKO Poliwag regardless of boosts using Razor Leaf.
Paralysis: Poliwag's paltry initial power leaves it vulnerable to paralysis spreaders like Abra, Vileplume, Dragonair, Drowzee, and Porygon once Sleep Clause is in effect. Once paralyzed, it is easily overwhelmed by most foes due to its low bulk.
Moveset: Amnesia Sweeper
Description: Set Description
Hypnosis lets Poliwag put a foe to sleep and provides an opening to use Amnesia, which lets it 2HKO most foes and avoid a 2HKO from Thunderbolt and other special attacks. The choice between Hydro Pump and Surf is a matter of power versus consistency; Poliwag is already reliant on a very inaccurate move, further complicating this choice. While both Surf and Hydro Pump 2HKO most neutral targets, like Pinsir, some threats that are 2HKOed by a +2 Hydro Pump, such as Machamp and Porygon, either avoid or have extremely low odds to be 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Additionally, a +2 Surf is incapable of OHKOing Nidoqueen and Arcanine and has extremely low odds of OHKOing Rapidash, while +2 Hydro Pump has high odds to OHKO the former pair and will always OHKO the latter. Psychic is Poliwag's best attack against Water-types, like Staryu and Seaking; while Hydro Pump does similar amounts of damage, Psychic's higher accuracy and chance for a Special drop give it solid odds to 2HKO the former and 3HKO the latter at +2. It also helps against Grass-types, as after an Amnesia boost it has decent odds to 2HKO Vileplume, and it will always 2HKO Weepinbell.
Poliwag is an effective lead due to its high Speed and access to a sleep-inducing move, though it can also be used as an endgame cleaner. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are common threats that Poliwag loses to quite badly; Omanyte is a great partner, as it switches into all three of them. Paralysis is a great way to handle these faster threats, so Poliwag also appreciates support from Thunder Wave users like Dragonair and Porygon. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine themselves make great partners, as they can trade hits with each other and eliminate the status spreaders that give Poliwag trouble.

Format: OU
Overview: Poliwrath's ugly typing and unremarkable stats give it a lot of trouble in RBY OU, but access to the rare Amnesia gives it a real niche as a wallbreaker. Unlike Amnesia users such as Slowbro and Snorlax, Poliwrath lacks the stats and typing to become unbreakable, but its Speed gives it a niche over them. Poliwrath outspeeds Exeggutor and can nail it with Blizzard after some chip damage, rather than having to fear Sleep Powder and Explosion like the other Amnesia users in the tier. It also possesses immediate threats against Chansey in the form of Hypnosis and Submission, which OHKOes with a critical hit.
However, while Poliwrath possesses these advantages over Slowbro, it suffers from all of Slowbro's flaws and more. It needs a lot of setup to break past Starmie and Chansey, which often threaten it with Thunderbolt, and it is vulnerable to Psychic, making Pokemon like Alakazam and Jynx much more problematic than they are for Slowbro. Like Slowbro, even after setting up, Poliwrath needs to watch for enemy Explosions that can stop the party before it even starts. Perhaps most importantly of all, Slowbro is able to heal itself throughout the game and provide utility thanks to superior defensive stats paired with Thunder Wave, while Poliwrath does not possess the bulk nor the movepool to be anything other than a one-time breaker.
Nevertheless, Poliwrath's Hydro Pumps deal incredible damage after only a few turns of Amnesia, which it can often find against paralyzed or sleeping foes, and it is capable of taking down multiple Pokemon in a single game if its primary checks, usually Starmie and Chansey, are either KOed by teammates or statused and weakened enough to be handled by Poliwrath itself. While inconsistent, Poliwrath is a Pokemon that can lead to good results if you build towards its strengths.
Comments: 
Moveset: Amnesia
Description: Poliwrath's viability in OU revolves around the combination of Amnesia and Hydro Pump. All would-be checks fall to it if they allow enough free turns: Starmie has great odds to be 2HKOed at +4, Alakazam is 2HKOed at +2 and OHKOed at +6, and even Chansey cannot survive two +6 Hydro Pumps. Other Pokemon that may attempt to finish off a weakened or crippled Poliwrath are also significantly easier to take down with Hydro Pump than with Surf: Snorlax is OHKOed by +6 Hydro Pump but always stomachs a +6 Surf, while +4 is enough to drop Tauros. While the prospects of Hydro Pump's accuracy and PP will understandably scare players off, the favorable ranges this move reaches are simply too important.
In the third slot, a tool against Exeggutor is highly recommended: Blizzard will hit for over half its HP after a single Amnesia, but if the team has no plans to put any other foes to sleep, then Hypnosis is also a valid way of threatening it, while also doubling as a way for Poliwrath to give itself free turns. For the last slot, many options are viable: Submission provides an immediate critical hit OHKO threat on Chansey, though the accuracy and recoil make it fairly inconsistent, while Surf's accuracy can be appreciated in specific scenarios where the extra damage from Hydro Pump is not required. Other options such as Body Slam, Counter, Psychic, and Rest can also have merits in very specific scenarios but are strongly discouraged, as they do not contribute to Poliwrath's primary purpose as a wallbreaker.

Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the ban on Sleep-inducing moves and Lapras becoming legal. Poliwrath is generally considered less viable in the current metagame, but its most up to date moveset is the following.
Comments: Other Options
Poliwrath has a genuinely massive movepool consisting of many interesting niche options. Psychic is somewhat useful on either set, as only Hypno and Kadabra resist it. It also happens to be Poliwrath’s strongest option against opposing Poliwrath and the rare Venomoth. However, Poliwrath’s relatively low Special stat makes the move underwhelming, even if it hits the target for super effective damage; Tentacruel is only 4HKOed. Surf can be used on the bulky sleeper set but suffers from the same problems as Psychic. The move fails to OHKO Dugtrio and is outclassed by Earthquake when hitting neutral targets like Hypno and Kadabra. It is mainly useful for hitting Persian and Kangaskhan, but Hydro Pump and Submission are typically stronger though less reliable options. Hyper Beam is a strong option for finishing off neutral targets, especially those with a low Defense stat. It is Poliwrath’s strongest move against Hypno, Kadabra, Articuno, Gyarados, and Vaporeon. Seismic Toss gives Poliwrath a consistent option for damage against every Pokemon, scoring a 4HKO or better against every major threat, aside from Vaporeon and Kangaskhan. It is seldom the strongest option for any Pokemon, but it reliably hits anything that could switch in. Counter is an interesting option for Persian, Kangaskhan, Vaporeon, and Omastar,which are quite likely to use a Normal-type move when facing Poliwrath, but it's difficult to fit into conventional sets.
Checks and Counters
Hypno and Kadabra: Hypno and Kadabra can easily 2HKO Poliwrath with Psychic. Aside from Hypnosis and Amnesia-boosted attacks, Poliwrath can only 4HKO or attempt to freeze Hypno. While Kadabra is much easier to KO, it outspeeds Poliwrath, which makes Poliwrath largely unable to threaten it. Kadabra’s high critical hit rate is also frightening for Poliwrath, as a critical hit Psychic will always OHKO, even after Amnesia boosts.
Gyarados: Unboosted Poliwrath lacks any tools to meaningfully threaten Gyarados outside of Hypnosis. Gyarados, meanwhile, outspeeds Poliwrath and will 2HKO it with Thunderbolt about one third of the time. Gyarados can even come in for free if it can correctly predict Earthquake. Additionally, Gyarados's impressive Attack allows it to pressure Poliwrath even after Amnesia.
Venusaur: Venusaur outspeeds Poliwrath and can deal massive damage with Razor Leaf. Thanks to the move's near-guaranteed critical hit, it will virtually always 2HKO Poliwrath even if it has used Amnesia. Additionally, Venusaur has a faster and more accurate sleep move than Poliwrath, giving it ample ability to pressure Poliwrath even at full health. Poliwrath can threaten Venusaur with a 3HKO from Blizzard, however.
Thunderbolt Users: Poliwrath's mediocre Special and Water typing leave it highly susceptible to Thunderbolt users. Electabuzz, Raichu, and Electrode are guaranteed to 2HKO Poliwrath and have high critical hit rates. Weaker and less common Thunderbolt users like Gyarados, Dragonite, Persian, Clefable, and Raticate also can deal pretty hefty damage to Poliwrath.
Dodrio: Dodrio's powerful Drill Peck is extremely likely to 2HKO Poliwrath. While Dodrio does fear Blizzard, it can potentially come in on Earthquake or Body Slam and still take out Poliwrath before Blizzard can KO it. Additionally, Dodrio can punish Rest very harshly, potentially setting up with Agility on top of getting the KO.
Partial-trapping Moves: Because Poliwrath has many exploitable weaknesses and is relatively slow, it is not overly difficult to whittle down with Wrap or Bind and pivot to a strong attacker that can finish it off. While Poliwrath has the potential to 2HKO all notable partial-trappers, Tentacruel, Dragonite, and Pinsir are still frequently used to handle Poliwrath. Additionally, if Dragonite hasn't sustained any damage, it is guaranteed to survive Blizzard, meaning it can set up with Agility unless Poliwrath happens to carry Toxic or land Hypnosis.
Bulky Water-type Pokemon: Bulky Water-type Pokemon, most notably Vaporeon, take little damage from all of Poliwrath's moves. Dewgong functions similarly, but is quite weak to Submission. Bulky Water-type Pokemon can't do too much in return outside of paralysis from Body Slam, however. Interestingly, Poliwrath is actually a solid check to itself once Sleep Clause is in effect, as no move aside from Psychic can 3HKO it.

Outdated Analysis
Overview
Poliwrath has very steep competition as one of many significant Water-type Pokemon in RBY UU. It does not have the speed of Tentacruel, the bulk of Vaporeon, the typing of Omastar, or the powerful STAB Ice-type moves of Dewgong. What Poliwrath does have, though, is one of the most diverse and interesting movepools of any Pokemon in the tier. For starters, it's the only legal fully evolved Water-type Pokemon with a sleep-inducing move, that being Hypnosis. While Hypnosis has underwhelming accuracy, it is a unique tool that threatens slower foes such as Hypno and deters quicker foes such as Tentacruel from switching in. Offensively, Poliwrath has options such as Body Slam, Earthquake, Submission, and Psychic on top of the staples Surf and Blizzard. While it can’t run all of these moves, Poliwrath can be tricky to play around and require scouting. To make it even more dynamic, Poliwrath also has Amnesia as a niche option that improves its offensive prowess and longevity. On top of all these options, Poliwrath can still serve as a traditional bulky Water-type Pokemon, being a soft check to Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio.
Despite its impressive advantages, Poliwrath is just short of truly being a staple in RBY UU. The most obvious weakness is its typing; while having a powered-up Submission and resisting Rock Slide are good traits, being weak to Psychic and Flying far outweighs the positives. Hypno and Kadabra are incredibly common and enormously threatening, giving Poliwrath a major disadvantage not faced by other slow Water-type Pokemon. While Dodrio is less common, it too can easily knock out Poliwrath. Aside from this, Poliwrath has truly mediocre stats, lacking even one base stat with three digits. Physically, Poliwrath shines a little bit, as it has marginally more bulk than Vaporeon and Dewgong and hits as hard as Articuno. However, it is still outdone defensively by Omastar and offensively by most dedicated physical attackers. Specially, Poliwrath is very exploitable, being less bulky than even Dewgong by a fairly large margin. Its offensive options are similarly underwhelming; notably, Poliwrath’s Blizzard will always fail to OHKO Dragonite without a critical hit, meaning it can't reliably prevent AgiliWrap like other Water-type Pokemon. Poliwrath is a niche option with several unfortunate shortcomings, fitting best on teams that need a bulky Water-type Pokemon and a sleeper in one Pokemon.

Description: Set Description
Hypnosis is Poliwrath’s biggest selling point over conventional Water-type Pokemon. The move can be used in a number of ways to get an advantage, especially early-game. If Poliwrath can get in against the slower Hypno, it's usually free to induce sleep. This can be accomplished by switching in as Hypno wakes up from Rest, or by using a Pokemon like Kadabra or Electabuzz to bait it in. Poliwrath also happens to be faster than Vaporeon and Omastar while Speed tying with Dewgong, meaning it can easily threaten them with Hypnosis as well. Unlike Hypno, these Pokemon struggle to punish Poliwrath if it misses. While it is typically used early-game, Hypnosis is a decent tool throughout the entire match, as it gives Poliwrath an option to stymie dangerous sweepers like Dugtrio, Aerodactyl, and Articuno. Blizzard hits many key targets in the metagame for respectable damage. Blizzard 2HKOes Dugtrio, Dragonite, and Aerodactyl and 3HKOes Tangela and Venusaur. The damage on Dragonite is especially important, as Poliwrath has limited tools to stop AgiliWrap, especially if it has already hit something with Hypnosis. Poliwrath will typically make use of a physical move, as its decent Attack allows it to deal solid damage to Water-type Pokemon, especially Tentacruel and Omastar. Earthquake is a common choice because it can 2HKO Tentacruel over half the time. Tentacruel is fairly hesitant to engage with Poliwrath, as Earthquake can deal immense damage on the switch or if Wrap misses. Earthquake is also notable for 2HKOing Haunter, Electabuzz, and Raichu and almost certainly 3HKOing Omastar.
Poliwrath’s final moveslot is usually dedicated to additional coverage or Rest. Body Slam is much weaker than Earthquake, but the chance for paralysis is very helpful for stymieing partial-trappers like Dragonite and offensive checks like Gyarados, Kadabra, and Electric-type Pokemon. Submission is another strong option that applies a lot of pressure to Normal-type Pokemon while also giving Poliwrath more options for Rock- and Ice-type Pokemon. Submission always 2HKOes Persian and can 2HKO Kangaskhan, Clefable, and Dewgong. Despite these advantages, Submission is not an overly common choice due to its low accuracy and dreadful recoil, which limit a Pokemon that is already not very bulky. Hydro Pump is Poliwrath’s strongest move against neutral targets like Hypno. The move is guaranteed to OHKO Dugtrio and Golem. Additionally, Hydro Pump 4HKOes Hypno and is Poliwrath's best option for hitting Kangaskhan and Persian after Submission. Lastly, Rest helps extend Poliwrath’s usefulness throughout the game. The move is most useful when Poliwrath is expected to take a more defensive role, such as checking Dugtrio or Articuno. However, Poliwrath’s numerous weaknesses leave it very vulnerable while it is asleep.
Poliwrath is best suited for teams that appreciate the offensive advantages of sleep and the defensive advantages of a bulky Water-type Pokemon. Because of its somewhat quick Hypnosis, Pokemon that can bait in Hypno, Tangela, and bulky Water-type Pokemon tend to be good partners. These include Kadabra, Electabuzz, Raichu, and Kangaskhan. Wrappers like Tentacruel and Dragonite are also helpful for pivoting so Poliwrath can get in more safely. Poliwrath's ability to soft check Articuno and physical attackers like Dugtrio and Kangaskhan means it works quite well with Flying-, Ground-, and Electric-type Pokemon. Flying-type Pokemon are additionally good partners thanks to Poliwrath's resistance to Rock. This means Poliwrath can get in rather safely against Dugtrio if it needs to. Due to its Psychic weakness, Poliwrath typically requires the support of multiple Psychic-type Pokemon, making both Hypno and Kadabra standard partners. Pokemon like Tangela, Dragonite, Dugtrio, and Golem are also good for patching up weak spots that Poliwrath might bring to a team. Agility sweepers like Articuno, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Hypnosis incapacitating a key Pokemon or providing them with an opportunity to set up.

Moveset: Amnesia
Description: Set Description
After Hypnosis, Amnesia is the next most interesting option available to Poliwrath. Successfully setting up with Amnesia is fairly difficult in RBY UU, primarily due to the abundant use of Wrap. While Poliwrath doesn’t suffer a ton of damage from Wrap, it is not uncommon for a Pokemon such as Tentacruel to switch in as Poliwrath first uses Amnesia, use Wrap to chip it, and pivot out to something that can pick Poliwrath off. This issue is worsened by the fact that Amnesia does nothing for Poliwrath’s weakness to Drill Peck, meaning Dodrio can always knock out Poliwrath once its health drops below 50%. Additionally, Poliwrath competes with the already uncommon Golduck in this role, which has superior typing and Speed for an easier time when setting up. However, Amnesia still demands a lot of respect to deal with, meaning that it can drive very predictable switches that can be exploited. For example, if the opponent relies on Tentacruel to pressure Amnesia Poliwrath, mixing in Hypnosis or Earthquake can harshly punish the switch-in.
If the opponent lacks strong options to finish off a weakened Poliwrath, like Kadabra or Dodrio, Amnesia becomes a lot more practical. Even if Wrap is still on the table, Poliwrath’s above-average physical bulk enables it to stomach a few hits as it waits for misses, during which it can boost, attack, or heal with Rest. If Wrap isn’t present, Poliwrath really only fears critical and being frozen, meaning it can set up in front of a surprisingly large number of Pokemon, most notably Articuno and bulky Water-type Pokemon. Surf is generally the special move of choice due to STAB and its high PP. At +4 Special, Surf will 2HKO every neutral target in the tier. At +6, Surf can 3HKO even the mighty Vaporeon, meaning nothing can Rest stall Poliwrath. Blizzard is often used alongside Surf for perfect coverage against everything but Water-type Pokemon. It also allows Poliwrath to threaten Dragonite, Venusaur, and Tangela without boosting. Earthquake and Hypnosis can alternatively be used to punish common switch-ins to Amnesia Poliwrath, most notably Tentacruel. Hypnosis can also potentially net Poliwrath a free turn to set up, which can be crucial for extra damage or bulk.
Amnesia Poliwrath requires a lot of support to function properly, as a number of things can go wrong. Dodrio and Venusaur are entirely unfazed by Poliwrath’s boosting and can reliably KO it once it drops below 50%, so Pokemon that can handle them are quite helpful; these include Rock-, Ice-, and Flying-type Pokemon. Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kadabra, and Kangaskhan can pressure common Poliwrath switch-ins like Tentacruel, Electabuzz, Hypno, and Kadabra, which can often come in for free when the opponent expects Poliwrath to use Amnesia. This makes Pokemon like Dugtrio, Kanagaskhan, and Kadabra notable partners. If Poliwrath is not running Hypnosis, sleepers like Haunter, Venusaur, and Tangela are good choices, as they help it find free turns to set up or quickly dispatch a key threat. Paralysis spreaders make it hard for physical attackers like Persian and Kangaskhan to punish Poliwrath while it is asleep from Rest.

Overview: Primeape stands out thanks to its valuable offensive typing and great offensive movepool, with access to relevant moves such as Rock Slide, Thunderbolt, and STAB Submission. This coverage allows Primeape to succeed far more consistently than any of the other Fighting-types available. Its damage output is also impressive, allowing it to 2HKO or 3HKO the vast majority of Pokemon in the tier, including notable threats such as Clefable and Moltres. Perhaps most importantly, its great Speed stat allows it to outspeed notable fast Pokemon such as Moltres and Mr. Mime. The attached 18.55% critical hit rate further boosts its offensive potency. This rate is especially important versus defensive Pokemon such as Golem and Blastoise, as a singular critical hit Submission or Thunderbolt will turn a 3HKO into a 2HKO. Clefable, Charizard, Moltres, and Kabutops are all OHKOed by either a critical hit Submission or Rock Slide.
While Primeape is incredibly strong, its frailness and Psychic weakness allow for little defensive utility, with it losing to common Pokemon like Mr. Mime. Also, while its Speed is impressive, it's not quite enough to stop Fire Spin users such as Charizard and Ninetales from taking advantage of it. Primeape's reliance on its Speed also causes paralysis to cripple it, meaning Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Exeggcute, and Electrode force it out. Other physical attackers, such as Raticate and Charizard, typically provide more defensive utility for equally comparable power.

Moveset: All-out Attacker
Description: Submission is Primeape's primary attacking move, 2HKOing Clefable and Wigglytuff, as well as Golem with minor chip damage. However, a Counter from Clefable or Wigglytuff will punish it, so scouting their movesets prior is recommended. Body Slam grants Primeape some measure of self-sufficiency by spreading paralysis to support it. It also acts as a way to discourage switch-ins, as Pokemon like Charizard and Nidoking hate paralysis; Charizard is also liable to be KOed by Rock Slide thereafter. Rock Slide also lets Primeape punish the plethora of other viable Fire-types, 2HKOing Moltres as well as Ninetales, Arcanine, and Rapidash after some chip damage. Hyper Beam is Primeape's strongest attack, allowing it to revenge kill from high percentages. In addition, Hyper Beam prevents Rest Exeggcute from walling Primeape, with two Body Slams into critical hit Hyper Beam being a guaranteed KO. Alternatively, Thunderbolt is Primeape's strongest option against Blastoise, Seadra, and Kingler, 2HKOing the latter 91.5% of the time.
Primeape is decently customizable due to its sizeable movepool. Thunder is a guaranteed 3HKO on Blastoise and Seadra, while with Thunderbolt this is only a chance. However, Thunder's poor accuracy leaves it as a niche option. Low Kick is a decent alternative to Submission, forgoing power for a chance to flinch the foe. This allows it to occasionally brute force through foes at high health without taking damage in the process. Counter can be used to heavily damage physical attackers such as Pinsir and Raticate, but it requires some level of prediction in order to be effective. Primeape can use Toxic to check AgiliWrap Dragonair and Fire Spin users, as they will take more damage from Toxic than it will deal with Wrap. Finally, Mega Kick deals high damage to some of Primeape's most notable checks, pairing with Hyper Beam to secure KOs on Nidoking, Mr. Mime, and Exeggcute. However, Mega Kick's mediocre accuracy leaves much to be desired.
Primeape fits well on teams with multiple Flying- and Bug-types such as Charizard, Moltres, Pinsir, and Venomoth, as it resists Rock Slide while also threatening opposing Fire-types that check them. Primeape is also great at absorbing Toxic, due to its dislike of paralysis, which lets it protect Fire Spin Charizard and Moltres. It also pairs especially well with dedicated checks to Mr. Mime. Once Mr. Mime is sizably chipped, Primeape can outspeed and revenge kill it, removing one of its biggest roadblocks in the process. Notable Mr. Mime checks include Clefable, Exeggcute, Drowzee, and even your own Mr. Mime. Primeape is most successful when used as a mid-game wallbreaker, as most of its coveted targets like Clefable, Moltres, and Kingler come into play then. Punishing these Pokemon grants openings for its teammates to sweep later on.

Overview: High base Attack and Speed combined with solid offensive tools grant Primeape a decent offensive presence. It's capable of threatening just about everything in the tier with either super effective coverage or Body Slam paralysis. Additionally, it's one of the few Pokemon that can reliably 2HKO Porygon with its STAB Submission. However, its bulk is quite poor, so the majority of the tier can 2HKO or 3HKO it. It's also very weak to paralysis, limiting its ability to actually break though defensive pieces like Porygon. To make matters worse, Primeape's offensive presence has major flaws. Body Slam's paralysis chance is often not enough to justify using a Pokemon that deals little damage to common bulky threats like Nidoqueen and Machamp. Its Speed, while fast, fails against the omnipresent Rapidash and Fearow. While it can force paralysis on some important Pokemon and sometimes even get a KO, teams typically prefer offensive threats with higher reward, and thus it's recommended that players avoid using Primeape.
Comments: Other Options
Since Body Slam is still quite threatening to Fire-types, Thunderbolt can be used over Rock Slide. It still 3HKOes Fearow and is Primeape's strongest attack against Slowpoke. Against other Water-types, Thunderbolt and Submission deal similar damage, but Thunderbolt lacks recoil and has much better accuracy. However, Primeape struggles to damage Pinsir without Rock Slide. Low Kick can flinch past some bulky threats when combined with paralysis support, but this strategy is very inconsistent and Low Kick has little use otherwise. Counter can 2HKO some would-be checks like Pinsir and Machamp, but it is very prediction-reliant and has little use against most other threats.
Checks and Counters
Fearow: Fearow is immune to paralysis from Body Slam and can outspeed and 2HKO Primeape with Drill Peck. However, it has a 16.2% chance to be 2HKOed by Rock Slide.
Rapidash: Rapidash outspeeds Primeape and has a 55.2% chance to 2HKO it with Fire Blast, which also threatens to burn it. In return, Primeape can only 3HKO with Rock Slide. However, Rapidash must watch out for a Body Slam paralysis.
Bulky threats: Machamp is only 4HKOed by Submission and takes less than 40% from Hyper Beam, and it can 3HKO Primeape with its Submission or Earthquake. Nidoqueen can 2HKO Primeape with Earthquake, and Primeape's Body Slam is only a 5HKO in return; Hyper Beam deals less than 40% to Nidoqueen.
Gastly: Gastly is immune to or takes minimal damage form all of Primeape's attacks barring Rock Slide, which can only 3HKO it, while Gastly can 2HKO with Psychic.
Paralysis: The vast majority of the tier has little issue breaking through Primeape's low defenses once its Speed is gone. Common Thunder Wave users like Dragonair and Drowzee easily tank two hits from Primeape and paralyze it back. While Porygon does not want to lose over half its health from Submission, it can also take a hit and paralyze Primeape in a pinch.
Moveset: All-out Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Submission serves as Primeape's main STAB attack and lets it 2HKO some defensive Pokemon like Porygon, Omanyte and Graveler. Body Slam is Primeape's most spammable attack and lets it fish for paralysis against switch-ins. Hyper Beam is Primeape's most powerful attack, letting it finish off weakened threats that are out of range of its other attacks, such as Dragonair and Drowzee below half HP and Nidoqueen and Machamp below 40%. It also lets Primeape OHKO Abra. Rock Slide hits Fire-types, Pinsir, and Fearow for super effective damage, usually 3HKOing them.
Rapidash and Fearow outspeed Primeape and can easily overwhelm it, so Omanyte is a great partner for its ability to switch into them. Gastly can also pivot into all of Primeape's attacks barring Rock Slide and win the one-on-one with Psychic, which makes Abra and Drowzee good partners. Drowzee has the added benefit of switching into Thunder Wave users fairly well, which helps Primeape avoid getting paralyzed. Primeape struggles to break though Nidoqueen and Machamp; your own Machamp and Fearow, respectively, can be used to handle those dangerous threats.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Raichu is generally considered good in the current metagame
<hr>
Raichu has a niche in UU as an Electric-type that can threaten Ground-types like Golem thanks to its access to Surf. The combination of Surf and STAB Thunderbolt gives it excellent coverage and sweeping potential that can be difficult for many teams to handle. In addition, Raichu's Speed allows it to tie with the ever-present Tentacruel, as well as Dodrio. On top of that, the 19.53% critical hit rate its base Speed provides makes it surprisingly powerful offensively. It can further increase this Speed while invalidating the Speed drop from paralysis thanks to Agility, which comes with the added bonus of outspeeding Dugtrio. Furthermore, Raichu is quite customizable, possessing a wide movepool with moves like Body Slam and Seismic Toss to make use of.
However, Raichu is physically frail, taking significant damage from threats like Dodrio, Persian, and Kangaskhan. In fact, it's not uncommon to see Raichu get KOed by their STAB Hyper Beams from around 80%. This fragility notably comes into play against Dugtrio, which can KO it consistently with Earthquake if it's taken even a minute amount of damage. It's not stellar on the Special end either, with threats like Tentacruel, Vaporeon, Hypno, and Kadabra all claiming 3HKOs on it with their STAB attacks. This has a negative effect on its offenses as well, with its Thunderbolt only 3HKOing Vaporeon and occasionally missing the OHKO on Gyarados. Raichu also competes heavily with Electabuzz for a place on teams, which has higher Speed than tier-king Tentacruel without the need to boost.
Comments: Other Options
Raichu's customizable nature gives it a fair amount of room to explore alternative options without much opportunity cost. However, Thunderbolt and Surf should never be dropped, as they are what allow it to perform well in the tier. If using Agility, Hyper Beam is quite desirable for closing out games against Pokemon like Hypno and Kadabra, which may come in to try and stop a sweep. It serves as Raichu's single best option against opposing Electric- and Grass-types, dealing surprisingly high damage to them and enabling it to break through. Seismic Toss is another appealing option, allowing Raichu to fight Grass-types like Tangela and Venusaur and Electric-types like Electabuzz and opposing Raichu. Surf tends to deal more damage to other Pokemon, though, making Seismic Toss a bit more specific in utility. Thunder has a significant enough damage difference to net Raichu near-guaranteed 2HKOs on Persian, Kangaskhan, Tentacruel, and Vaporeon and an OHKO against Dodrio, but the inconsistency makes it difficult to recommend, especially considering Raichu's fragility. Substitute can be used to give Raichu an opportunity to scout and spread paralysis without needing to predict. It has the added benefit of letting Raichu safely fish for critical hits and full paralysis. It also makes Raichu an even better Dugtrio lure, letting it fish for a critical hit from Surf to OHKO it or paralysis from Body Slam without taking massive damage.
Checks and Counters
Grass-types: Tangela is one of the few Pokemon in the tier that resists Raichu's Thunderbolt + Surf combination, and, as a result, Raichu can't do much to it. The only way for Raichu to win is through Seismic Toss, but even then, Tangela's Stun Spore will paralyze Raichu and put it into an awkward position. Tangela will usually use Raichu as setup fodder thereafter, picking up Growth boosts or using it to pivot out with Bind. While less common, Venusaur is also a large threat to Raichu's success, resisting everything thrown at it while threatening with Sleep Powder or a 3HKO with Razor Leaf. In addition, it's only 4HKOed by Seismic Toss, which is, unfortunately, Raichu's best bet at trying to win.
Strong Physical Attackers: Raichu is extremely frail on the physical side, and there are threats in RBY UU that are well equipped to exploit this. Kangaskhan and Dodrio can KO Raichu from well above half HP with Hyper Beam, meaning all Raichu can do is threaten them with Thunder Wave if it's at full HP. Furthermore, Persian can revenge kill Raichu from half HP with Slash if it hasn't set up Agility. On the flip side, Raichu can fight back hard against all of these threats; none of them want to switch into Thunder Wave, Dodrio falls to Thunderbolt if it's taken any amount of damage, and Kangaskhan takes heavy damage from any special hit. As a result, while Raichu is very threatened by these Pokemon, they really don't want to switch into it.
Dragonite: Dragonite can shrug off Thunder Wave with its own Agility and KO Raichu with Hyper Beam from 68.7% onwards. This can be facilitated through Wrap, which gradually chips Raichu into KO range; at minimum, it takes five Wrap uses for Raichu to be placed in Hyper Beam range. Raichu can't deal much damage to Dragonite at all, with Thunderbolt dealing less than 30%. As a result, Raichu is forced out.
Hypno: Hypno can take Raichu's attacks quite well by virtue of its excellent special bulk. This, combined with Thunder Wave and the power of Psychic, enables it to check Raichu well. However, it can only check Raichu from full HP, as, otherwise, it's very possible for Raichu to break through with critical hits. Alternatively, Raichu can use Hypno as setup fodder for Agility if it has used Rest, especially if brought in on the turn Hypno uses it, but it needs multiple critical hits to break through in this scenario. Furthermore, it risks paralysis and heavy damage in the process.
Electric-types: Raichu tends to struggle against opposing Electric-types, as they take mediocre damage from Surf while resisting Thunderbolt. Electabuzz tends to win one-on-one with Seismic Toss while being faster and threatening with paralysis. Opposing Raichu may also be equipped to win against your own depending on the set, with moves such as Seismic Toss and Hyper Beam further complicating matters for the electric rodent.
Dugtrio: Raichu can't stomach Dugtrio's Earthquake if it's taken any amount of damage, and Dugtrio's 23.4% critical hit rate makes it an even more decisive matchup. However, if Raichu has set up Agility or if Dugtrio is switching in, Dugtrio has to risk getting hit with Surf, which 2HKOes it. This also means that Dugtrio has a lot of trouble beating Raichu if it's been paralyzed prior to the interaction. Body Slam is also a risk for Dugtrio, potentially paralyzing it and allowing Raichu to take it out if it's taken damage prior.
Moveset: Agility Sweeper
Description: Set Description
Thunderbolt and Surf provide Raichu with nigh-unresisted coverage, making it challenging to counter once it's in safely. Thunder Wave gives Raichu ample opportunity to spread paralysis for its teammates, which can be helpful for forcing out faster threats like Persian and Tentacruel. Agility enables Raichu to double its Speed, making it difficult to revenge kill or pin down with Wrap. This is very important, as, in RBY, boosting Speed allows Raichu to ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. However, Body Slam can be used instead to paralyze threats like Dugtrio switching in and beat physically frail Pokemon like Kadabra.
Raichu wants to set up Agility to sweep through weakened teams, and it should be kept healthy so Dugtrio cannot KO it after surviving Surf. As such, Raichu does best mid- or late-game. While setting up can be difficult in RBY UU at times, Raichu has a decent amount of freedom to set up Agility, as it can afford to take a hit if Dugtrio is absent or unable to survive Surf. Forcing out Pokemon like Omastar, which can't handle Raichu's coverage, can also allow Raichu to set up. Sleeping Pokemon can be fairly useful for Raichu to set up against; however, bulkier Pokemon like Hypno may be difficult if the sleep was induced by Rest, as Raichu can't KO it before it wakes up.
Raichu tends to find points of entry through Wrap pivots like Tentacruel, ensuring safety from physical attacks. However, it can switch into weaker special attackers if necessary, as well as more passive Pokemon using recovery moves. Thanks to its Speed and coverage, it also makes a good revenge killer, especially after an Explosion, which usually softens up a threat for Raichu to consistently threaten the KO. On the flip side, Raichu's Speed can let it switch in on opposing Wrap, though with repeated switches it may take enough chip damage to enter KO range for strong physical attacks. This only gets worse if the Wrap user pivots out to a counter. Ergo, switching into Wrap even a few times severely limits Raichu's ability to take hits and check threats, so this risk should only be taken if heavy-hitting physical attackers like Dugtrio have been accounted for or removed, or if Raichu can reliably threaten to KO the Wrap user. Raichu finds itself on teams that benefit from its ability to check Rock- and Ground-types that threaten teammates like Dodrio and Persian, making them effective lures for said Rock- and Ground-types.

Format: OU
Overview: Raichu carves out a niche for itself in OU as the only fully evolved Electric-type with access to Water-type coverage; this lets it almost always OHKO Rhydon and Golem, which other Electric-types, such as Jolteon and Zapdos, are walled by. Raichu can use its unique coverage to force paralysis past usual paralysis absorbers, such as Starmie and Chansey, and onto foes that will usually attempt to avoid paralysis, such as Exeggutor and Alakazam.
However, Raichu is 3HKOed at best by most physical attacks and loses one-on-one to nearly every physical attacker. It also gives free entry to Grass-types, such as Victreebel and Exeggutor, and is effectively forced stay in and absorb Sleep Powder. It competes with Jolteon and Zapdos, which, aside from lacking Surf, are better in almost every way. Raichu is able to perform as a decent mixed attacker, but it is too frail, too vulnerable to status, and too weak to make up for it in the vast majority of situations.
Comments: Other Options
Surf and Submission are both droppable within reason, as Rhydon and Golem still have to fear the potential of Raichu having Surf, and Submission's accuracy and recoil make it unreliable even for its intended purpose; Raichu can drop either one. Seismic Toss 4HKOes Exeggutor, Alakazam, and Jolteon and is Raichu's best option to hit Exeggutor. Body Slam has an 87.7% chance to 4HKO Jolteon and a slim chance to 4HKO Chansey. It also 6HKOes Exeggutor, but it is generally lacking in power, and Raichu would much rather run Submission or Seismic Toss. Hyper Beam 2HKOes Jynx and Alakazam and deals decent damage to other foes, such as Chansey and Jolteon. Agility can be used to outspeed faster foes, such as Alakazam, even if Raichu is paralyzed.
Checks and Counters
Exeggutor: Exeggutor walls Raichu's usual coverage and threatens back with status and a strong Psychic. However, Exeggutor is outsped and dislikes taking paralysis. Seismic Toss helps alleviate this slightly, as it 4HKOes Exeggutor.
Chansey: Raichu without Submission cannot pressure Chansey that well, 7HKOing it at best with Thunderbolt and almost always 5HKOing it with Body Slam, while Chansey can easily status and wear down Raichu in return. Even with Submission, Chansey can paralyze Raichu and try to heal off the damage in many situations, given Submission's 80% accuracy.
Snorlax: Snorlax 2HKOes Raichu with Earthquake and 3HKOes it with Body Slam, while Raichu can only 4HKO it in return with Thunderbolt.
Jolteon: Jolteon with Rest walls Raichu without Body Slam, and while it can't do much damage to Raichu, Jolteon will wear down Raichu over time. However, a sleeping Jolteon is extremely exploitable and can be forced out with ease by the likes of Tauros.
Alakazam: Alakazam 3HKOes Raichu with Psychic and walls it with Recover, although Alakazam hates paralysis.
Gengar and Tauros: Gengar and Tauros both outspeed Raichu and threaten it with Hypnosis and Earthquake, respectively. However, they both dislike paralysis and can't switch into Raichu's attacks well.
Moveset: Mixed Attacker
Description: Set Description
Thunderbolt 2HKOes Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro, 3HKOes Tauros and Lapras, and deals decent damage to other foes, such as Snorlax and Alakazam. Raichu can use Thunder Wave to push paralysis past usual paralysis absorbers such as Starmie and Chansey, as they are weak to Thunderbolt and Submission, respectively. Submission 3HKOes Chansey and does slightly more damage than Thunderbolt to Snorlax and Tauros. The recoil from Submission can also work in Raichu's favor, since if Raichu KOes itself with recoil against Chansey, the turn ends and Chansey can't heal off the damage. Surf OHKOes Rhydon 87.2% of the time and always OHKOes Golem.

Format: NU
Overview: Raticate acts as a fast revenge killer and wallbreaker in RBY NU, with Super Fang, Normal-type STAB moves, and immense coverage allowing it to 2HKO or 3HKO most of the tier. Raticate is one of the fastest available Pokemon, outspeeding Mr. Mime and Venomoth while only being outsped by Charizard, Ninetales, and the rare Electrode. Raticate's diverse coverage threatens Pokemon like Golem and Kabutops, and its sheer Speed allows it to threaten revenge kills against foes like Mr. Mime and Blastoise. Thanks to Super Fang combined with Hyper Beam or a coverage move, Raticate 2HKOes Pokemon like Venomoth, Mr. Mime, Golem, and even potentially Charizard. This can allow it to sweep or help enable sweepers like Charizard, Kabutops, and Kingler. STAB Body Slam deals excellent damage and is incredibly difficult to switch into, as opponents have to fear Super Fang obliterating their bulky Rock- or Normal-types. Raticate's main issues are its horrid bulk, fear of Counter, and near inability to function if paralyzed.
Comments: Other Options
Raticate has abundant coverage but lacks the stats to back it up; however, it may be customized to check threats that the rest of its team cannot safely handle. Thunder guarantees a 2HKO on Kingler but misses crucial ranges against other Water-types and is usually not better than simply hoping for a critical hit. Blizzard deals heavy damage to Fearow, Exeggcute, and Nidoking, usually 2HKOing the first two and 3HKOing Nidoking while potentially freezing; it also still deals heavy damage to Golem but usually misses the 2HKO.
Checks and Counters
Charizard and Ninetales: Charizard and Ninetales outspeed Raticate and 2HKO it with Fire Blast, though missing might get them 2HKOed. Fire Blast's burn chance also threatens to leave Raticate ineffectual.
Paralysis: Raticate cannot bully its foes when it is slower than them, and its frailty shines through when it has to take hits before dealing them; the vast majority of NU 2HKOes it.
Counter: Because Raticate relies on Hyper Beam and often uses Super Fang, Counter will usually threaten a retaliatory KO. Furthermore, if a Counter user switches in on Raticate and forces it out, the Raticate user risks massive damage to their switch-in. Potential Counter users include Charizard, Clefable, Wigglytuff, Blastoise, and Primeape, with Blastoise in particular nearly always carrying it. Raticate can potentially exploit Counter attempts with Thunderbolt, however, especially against Charizard and Blastoise.
Moveset: All-out Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Hyper Beam is the only required move, as it finishes off dangerous foes such as Clefable, Venomoth, and Mr. Mime from 44%, 56%, and 65% HP. Raticate then chooses from three of four moves. Body Slam's paralysis chance makes Raticate difficult to switch into in general, and Body Slam + Hyper Beam also KOes Mr. Mime, allowing Raticate to fish for paralysis to maintain its Speed advantage while still 2HKOing it easily. Super Fang is a common component of Raticate's strategy, making switches incredibly risky even for Rock-types, Clefable, and Wigglytuff. The Super Fang + Hyper Beam combination notably 2HKOes Mr. Mime, Venomoth, and Exeggcute, sometimes 2HKOes Charizard and Nidoking, and rarely can even 2HKO Clefable. Even if Super Fang Raticate can't get the KO, its teammates probably will. Bubble Beam is the ideal coverage move, 2HKOing Golem. Thunderbolt 3HKOes Kabutops and Kingler, and Thunderbolt twice followed by Hyper Beam is enough to defeat Blastoise while avoiding a lethal Counter.
Raticate's strategy is simple: revenge kill weakened, slower foes where possible and look for safe opportunities to get in on valuable targets lacking Thunder Wave. Once in, Raticate can use Super Fang to leave the foe in KO range of Hyper Beam or Bubble Beam, or it can use Body Slam to deal heavy damage and punish switches. It can also potentially revenge kill one foe and then take paralysis in order to damage Mr. Mime or Clefable. Raticate baits switches due to its reliance on KOing with Hyper Beam, meaning Body Slam and Super Fang can punish pivots. Due to Raticate's low bulk, switching in is quite difficult; it can benefit from Fire Spin users if you are willing to risk a miss, or it can come in after an ally puts a foe to sleep. Raticate is ideally used on highly offensive teams that seek to leave the opposing team weakened and open to a fast attacker, whether that's Raticate itself or a teammate such as Mr. Mime or Charizard. Helpful teammates for Raticate include Golem, which can switch into Thunder Wave and help check Charizard, and paralysis spreaders like Mr. Mime and Clefable, which let Raticate defeat bulky foes such as Blastoise and opposing Clefable.

Overview: A cursory glance at Raticate may lead one to quickly disregard it as simply a worse Persian. Indeed, the cat and mouse share many similarities such as a Normal typing and access to Thunderbolt and Bubble Beam to strengthen specific matchups, but Raticate suffers from worse attacking stats and a significantly worse Speed tier. However, Raticate has a distinct niche thanks to its exclusive access to Super Fang. RBY OU is a metagame where KO ranges are a crucial factor for players to keep in mind, as nothing wants to be in range of an enemy Tauros. Super Fang's consistent damage is incredible for getting foes to these KO ranges and is guaranteed to leave a dent in anything that attempts to switch in; most importantly, Super Fang ignores type immunity against Gengar, which is one of Raticate's major strengths over Persian, as it limits the number of times that Gengar can switch in safely. Against frailer or weakened targets, Raticate can also threaten them with a Hyper Beam afterwards to KO; additionally, with its great base 97 Speed, it outpaces many Pokemon in the metagame, such as Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, and threatens them with massive damage.
Unfortunately, it's not all cheddar and fruit for this humble rodent. Raticate is incredibly frail, making it difficult to switch in and repeatedly wear down foes. This, combined with Super Fang's 89.5% accuracy and 16 PP, can allow faster foes like Starmie and Alakazam with reliable one-turn recovery moves to stall out Raticate's Super Fangs until it misses or runs out of PP. Raticate isn't just frail, either: its defensive profile is decidedly mediocre, meaning it can't afford to trade blows often and thus often loses a flat one-on-one fight; Super Fang's imperfect accuracy also means that missing an attack will force Raticate to take a potentially fatal blow in return, something it cannot afford. Finally, Raticate's attacking stats are very average, which often prevents it from KOing bulkier foes even after a Super Fang. As a result of these flaws, Raticate is heavily reliant on good prediction to be effective in its role, and as such, it is not recommended for most RBY OU teams because Tauros is normally all that's necessary. Even if a "second Tauros" is desirable, Persian is usually the better choice.

Moveset: Biggie Cheese (Super Fang)
Description: Raticate should be used exclusively mid- to late-game when faster foes such as Starmie have been paralyzed or as an emergency Snorlax switch-in. Super Fang is obligatory, as it is Raticate's only notable niche in OU and allows it to consistently deal significant damage; notably, it's able to wear down Snorlax, one of the premier defensive Pokemon in RBY. Hyper Beam is Raticate's strongest follow-up after a Super Fang, KOing non-Reflect Chansey and Alakazam as well as Victreebel most of the time. Body Slam is spammable and allows Raticate to fish for paralysis on common switch-ins like Starmie. It's also useful after Super Fang as a way to fish for paralysis as Alakazam or Starmie uses Recover. Bubble Beam is Raticate's preferred coverage move because it is very likely to KO Rhydon after Super Fang, which is likely to switch in anticipating a Body Slam or Hyper Beam.
While Raticate's first three moves are too important to drop, its last moveslot is more flexible; though, it should be noted that with the exception of Blizzard, replacing Bubble Beam will significantly compromise the Rhydon matchup. Thunderbolt can be used to hit Cloyster, potentially taking it out with a critical hit after a Super Fang. Tail Whip is an option that can be used to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, allowing a paralyzed Raticate to once again outspeed opposing paralyzed Pokemon while also putting foes in range for Raticate's attacks. Blizzard has a useful freeze chance and is Raticate's strongest option against Gengar and Dragonite, but it has a lower chance to KO Rhydon after a Super Fang than Bubble Beam. Finally, Quick Attack can be used to chip a faster foe such as Tauros before Raticate goes down, but it's very situational and Raticate struggles to find much room for it.

Overview: Raticate is a bit of a mixed bag. Its unique access to Super Fang allows it to weaken a Pokemon for threats like Dodrio to clean up later or outright KO foes itself with Hyper Beam. Not only that, Raticate also has an interesting special movepool that it can tap into akin to Persian, making it possible to fine-tune for a team. Raticate is also in a very unique Speed tier, being just above Haunter, and is immune to Body Slam paralysis thanks to being a Normal-type. Raticate's 18.97% critical hit rate adds significant volatility to many matchups as well, making it difficult to switch into when also considering Super Fang. These factors often let Raticate score at least one Super Fang before it goes down, which is more than enough for its teammates to break through and wreak havoc. All of these factors enable Raticate to fulfil a supportive role for its team while remaining a decent sweeper in its own right.
However, Raticate faces some stiff competition from Kangaskhan and Persian, which possess much better stats, coverage, and general offensive potential. In addition, Raticate has poor special bulk, with attacks like Tentacruel's Surf being a guaranteed 2HKO. This makes it a nightmare to bring in without heavy support or one-for-one trades. Furthermore, Raticate relies heavily on its Speed to make progress, making paralysis a death sentence due to its fragility. Overall, this makes Raticate a high-risk, high-reward Pokemon.
Comments: Other Options
Bubble Beam can replace Blizzard to 2HKO Golem or KO after a Super Fang on the switch. In addition, Bubble Beam's chance to lower Speed can let Raticate beat normally faster Pokemon that switch in expecting a Blizzard, such as Tentacruel. Without Blizzard, though, Raticate doesn't have a convincing way of stopping Dragonite from paralyzing it with Thunder Wave. Thunder can be used for a better matchup against Gyarados, possessing a guaranteed KO after Super Fang. It has little use outside of this, however, as Omastar and Vaporeon are only 2HKOed after Super Fang and will always win prolonged interactions. It is possible for Raticate to run two special moves at once—usually Blizzard and either Thunder or Bubble Beam—though this comes at the cost of Body Slam's consistency and potentially game-changing paralysis chance.
Checks and Counters
Haunter: Raticate can still halve Haunter's HP with Super Fang, but Blizzard does extremely poor damage. On the other hand, Haunter can 3HKO Raticate with Thunderbolt or put it to sleep with Hypnosis. Raticate will sometimes win one-on-one thanks to its Speed and Super Fang, but this is not consistent enough to recommend.
Omastar: Omastar resists Raticate's STAB moves, doesn't get OHKOed after a Super Fang, and easily 2HKOes Raticate with Hydro Pump. Omastar can switch in on a Hyper Beam, forcing Raticate out after it recharges and inflicting significant damage in the process. Raticate can use Thunder to try and get a better matchup, but Omastar takes no more than 36.1%, thus still winning one-on-one unless paralysis or critical hits are involved.
Paralysis: Raticate's best qualities are its Speed and access to Super Fang, which forces slower threats to take significant damage before they can land a hit. Ergo, paralysis is a massive threat to its success, and Raticate should avoid chipping threats that can paralyze it. Paralysis's Speed drop exposes Raticate's extreme fragility while further reducing the consistency of Super Fang, making it effectively dead weight in many situations. Threats like Hypno, Tangela, Dragonite, and Electabuzz that can paralyze Raticate force it out unless they're chipped already. Once Raticate has scored a KO, opponents often bring these Pokemon in, causing the Raticate user to lose a significant amount of momentum. It should be noted that Hypno and paralyzed Electabuzz can't switch into Raticate, as Super Fang + Hyper Beam has a favorable chance to KO them outright. Dragonite also can't switch into Raticate, as Blizzard will KO it after Super Fang.
Bulky Water-types: Bulky Water-types like Tentacruel and Vaporeon possess very effective ways to force out Raticate. Tentacruel can switch in on Super Fang if it isn't paralyzed and subsequently scare Raticate out with a 2HKO from Surf. However, Tentacruel is threatened with an outright KO from Super Fang + Hyper Beam. Vaporeon, on the other hand, survives Hyper Beam after a Super Fang and can still 2HKO Raticate with Surf.
Golem: Golem's Rock typing lets it easily switch in on Raticate's Hyper Beam and 2HKO it with Earthquake. Should Raticate lack a super effective move against Golem, it is very likely to lose the matchup. However, after a Super Fang, Raticate has a 41% chance to KO Golem with Blizzard and KOes it outright with Bubble Beam.
Moveset: Super Fang
Description: Set Description
Super Fang is the main reason you would use Raticate, as halving a foe's HP is extremely useful for supporting a team, and without it, Raticate is outclassed by Persian. Hyper Beam is used alongside Super Fang to KO Hypno most of the time, as well as take out threats like Tentacruel and Dodrio. It also allows Raticate to bring down a paralyzed team late-game. Body Slam reliably dents threats and spreads paralysis. Blizzard is used to 2HKO Dragonite or KO it after a Super Fang on the switch in.
Raticate can be used early-game thanks to the sheer utility of Super Fang, dealing significant damage to a foe and likely putting it into KO range for Raticate's teammates. Raticate is best used mid- or late-game, though, where Super Fang is most likely to help its teammates. Raticate is best switched in on passive foes that won't damage it, such as those immobilized by Wrap or about to use Recover or Rest. Smart double switching is also a good way to bring it in. However, bringing in Raticate to revenge kill a threat isn't out of the question either, especially if that threat is a faster Pokemon that has been bogged down with paralysis. Raticate should be playing hit-and-run first and foremost, as not only is it frail, but landing a Super Fang is more than enough to leave foes open to exploitation by Raticate's teammates anyway.

Overview: Sandslash is often overlooked in RBY OU, but it realizes a dangerous niche with its unique combination of typing, movepool, and Speed tier. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash can 2HKO every Pokemon in the tier, and it is just fast enough to outpace many crucial threats, including Rhydon, Chansey, and Exeggutor. It is frail in comparison to Rhydon and Golem and hits less hard, making it a poor pivot. However, it is faster, can sweep with Swords Dance, and beats the two one-on-one by virtue of its Ground neutrality. Its winning matchup against Rhydon, Electric immunity, and consistent STAB Earthquake make up for its lower offensive stats. In particular, its Thunder Wave immunity provides both a consistent entry point and a partial safeguard against sweep-ending paralysis, a weakness that plagues all other viable Swords Dance users. Unfortunately, Sandslash's lack of Normal and Flying resistances means it can't be a primary physical tank or a firm Zapdos answer, unlike Rhydon and Golem. It has low Speed, low Special, a plethora of weaknesses, and less Attack before setup, leaving it easily forced out and picked off. Most notably, Starmie can harry it in all stages of a battle. Unlike most other viable Swords Dance users, it misses the crucial OHKO on Chansey after a boost. Still, with paralysis support or against slower teams, Sandslash can be a potent offensive weapon while checking Rhydon, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Golem in emergencies.
Comments: Other Options
Sandslash has other moves that seem appealing, but all of the legitimate options have already been discussed. Rest could theoretically help it defensively, but it's too slow and burdened by weaknesses. A traditional physical tank set would be outclassed by Rhydon, Kabutops, or even Snorlax. Slash is a good move, but Kabutops uses it better, and it has poor synergy with Swords Dance. Seismic Toss is simply too weak to use, even before setting up. Toxic discourages partial trapping and forces out Reflect users, but it's too fringe and has many better users. Sand Attack can fish for safe turns to survive attacks or set up, but it's an inconsistent gimmick to spend a moveslot on.
Checks and Counters
Ice-types: All OU Ice-types can easily OHKO Sandslash. Cloyster is particularly threatening, as it outspeeds Sandslash and tanks its hits for easy momentum, though Blizzard only has about a 60% chance to OHKO from full health considering its accuracy. Further, Cloyster can get overburdened as a check to many threats, and lure options like Thunderbolt Tauros and Self-Destruct Snorlax can remove it. Lapras has less physical bulk and is outsped, making it vulnerable if worn down, but it can comfortably survive a +2 hit and always OHKO with Blizzard. Articuno and Jynx fold to boosted Rock Slide and Earthquake, respectively, but they outspeed and safely revenge kill Sandslash.
Starmie: Although it requires the rare Hydro Pump to OHKO Sandlash without a critical hit, Starmie is nonetheless the most common impediment to a Sandslash sweep. Great Speed, high Special, and Recover all help Starmie check Sandslash consistently. It can have some difficulty switching in, though, as it detests being paralyzed by Body Slam and takes a solid chunk from Earthquake. Starmie also takes upwards of 74% from a +2 Earthquake, meaning Sandslash can often power through if Starmie is worn down or paralyzed.
Tauros: Tauros tends to stop Sandslash dead in its tracks late-game by 2HKOing with Blizzard, serving as one of its biggest obstacles. However, it takes more than 60% from a +2 Earthquake, which can let the opposing Tauros easily win the vital mirror matchup. Oddball sets lacking Blizzard have a more difficult time, as Sandslash can sometimes survive two Body Slams into Hyper Beam. If Sandslash can boost to +4 Attack, it has good odds to OHKO Tauros with Earthquake or Submission, a feat that can often be game-deciding.
Grass-types: Although its improved matchup against Exeggutor is a major advantage of Sandslash over other Ground-types, it is far from guaranteed to win one-on-one. Hyper Beam misses, full paralysis from Stun Spore, and Mega Drain recovery can potentially let Exeggutor win. Even when Sandslash KOes Exeggutor, it often ends up paralyzed by Stun Spore or in Tauros's KO range. Exeggutor can, however, end up worn down throughout a match, letting Sandslash get past it more safely. In a pinch, +2 Body Slam into Hyper Beam will KO Exeggutor 84% of the time assuming both moves connect, while Earthquake or Rock Slide instead of Body Slam drops the odds to ~45% without the possibility of paralysis. If Exeggutor manages to switch into an unboosted Sandslash without taking heavy damage, the matchup shifts dramatically in Exeggutor's favor. Explosion and Mega Drain can also allow Exeggutor to force a direct trade. Beyond Exeggutor, Sandslash is completely vulnerable to Victreebel and Venusaur, being outsped and usually OHKOed while failing to OHKO either at +2, though neither enjoys switching in considering their neutrality to Earthquake and dislike of paralysis.
Fast Special Attackers: Alakazam can easily revenge kill weakened Sandslash, halting a sweep. Its prevalance in the lead matchup means it is often paralyzed, though, allowing Sandslash to OHKO it risk-free when set up. Jynx has a similar dynamic. Sandslash can try to set up on them late-game if they are paralyzed, especially with Substitute, but this is risky.
Flying-types: Sandslash is a shaky counter to Zapdos. It can't 2HKO Zapdos unboosted unless it runs Rock Slide, and it doesn't resist Drill Peck, making it significantly more vulnerable when switching in and after setting up. Other Flying-types have even better matchups, as Moltres threatens a burn and 2HKO with Fire Blast, while Articuno OHKOes Sandslash with just Ice Beam. Dragonite performs the best, as it is rarely OHKOed at +2 without the inferior Rock Slide, and Sandslash is both susceptible to Wrap and easily 2HKOed by Surf or Blizzard. Even niche Flying-types such as Dodrio and Gyarados can give Sandslash quite a bit of trouble. Rock Slide can substantially threaten these Pokemon, especially Moltres and Articuno, but neither are standard.
Paralysis: Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave but still vulnerable to Body Slam paralysis and Exeggutor's Stun Spore, both of which heavily diminish its effectiveness. Swords Dance can somewhat compensate for this if the foe is also paralyzed, as boosting will reapply the paralysis Speed drop, rendering the foe slower. That being said, losing its already-middling Speed tier is a death sentence with Sandslash's vulnerability to special attacks, especially considering the prevalence of Ice Beam and Blizzard on slow Pokemon like Chansey, Lapras, and even Snorlax. Even independent of the Speed drop, any full paralysis turns are particularly devastating for a sweeper.
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Set Description
Swords Dance is obligatory for Sandslash's niche. STAB Earthquake provides great neutral coverage and heavily chunks the majority of the metagame after a boost. If running Body Slam, Sandslash can use Body Slam + Hyper Beam for the best odds to 2HKO Exeggutor at +2—one of its most valuable advantages over Rhydon and Golem. Body Slam also allows Sandslash to fish for paralysis on its common switch-ins, which can help it or Tauros sweep late-game. Alternatively, Rock Slide can cover Flying-types and the rare Pinsir, but it's no stronger than Earthquake against Pokemon like Cloyster, Lapras, and Exeggutor. Furthermore, Body Slam into Hyper Beam still 2HKOes Zapdos at +2. Despite its poor accuracy, Submission allows Sandslash to OHKO on Tauros at +4 and can occasionally OHKO Chansey at +2 and Snorlax at +4. Tauros often spells the end of a Sandslash sweep, so Submission is a valuable option to consider. Substitute can be used over a coverage move, as it can afford Sandslash a free turn against a paralyzed foe, though it can be difficult to set up. Substitute further amplifies Sandslash's unique ability among Swords Dance users to defeat Zapdos, as Drill Peck only breaks it around 30% of the time, which may let Sandslash set up safely and sweep.
Sandslash can effectively check most Rock- or Electric-types, but—with the exception of Jolteon—doing so will usually prevent it from sweeping late-game. Therefore, you must determine whether a trade or the potential for a sweep is more valuable. To stay healthy to sweep, Sandslash is best brought in on Thunder Wave, partial trapping pivots, or double switches rather than directly into attacks. It greatly benefits from being hidden until late-game when it is in a position to sweep. If Sandslash is forced onto the field before a sweep is likely, it should generally lead with Body Slam to chip and potentially paralyze its checks, as using Swords Dance is rarely useful before the opponent's team has been fully scouted. When saved until late-game, Sandslash can greatly benefit from an opportunity to boost to +4, which allows Earthquake to secure OHKOs on Chansey and Starmie and OHKO Tauros a majority of the time. Additionally, +4 Hyper Beam OHKOes Zapdos about 60% of the time and Exeggutor about 40% of the time, limiting their ability to impede a sweep. Be aware that calculations for +4 Hyper Beam assume it hits and doesn't critically hit, a combined 78.09% chance, so it's riskier in practice.
Sandslash is at its most dangerous with paralysis support, and it has good synergy with many paralysis spreaders, including Zapdos, Starmie, Snorlax, and Chansey. The offensive prowess of Zapdos and Starmie in particular often forces paralysis on the opponent's team, either neutralizing foes like Jynx, Alakazam, and opposing Starmie or providing setup opportunities against slower foes like Chansey, Snorlax, and Exeggutor. Sandslash will then greatly enjoy coming in on these foes. In return, Sandslash can set up on and threaten the slow special tanks that limit them offensively, as well as effectively checking the Rock- and Electric- types that threaten them if a sweep seems infeasible. Its reduced physical tanking capabilities versus Rhydon and Golem and its Ice weakness make Cloyster an ideal defensive partner, and Sandslash feasts on the Thunderbolts Cloyster draws in. Additionally, Sandslash shares many switch-ins with Tauros, including Cloyster, Exeggutor, Slowbro, Snorlax, and Starmie, so it often clears the way for a Tauros endgame even if it cannot sweep. Lastly, Sandslash is prone to being hamstrung by Body Slam paralysis, so Reflect Snorlax can also be effective to block that paralysis and generally help with physical tanking, despite its lower immediate physical bulk. In return, Sandslash threatens an immediate OHKO on Gengar and heavily pressures Rhydon and Golem, which can give mono-Normal Snorlax issues. Snorlax is also invaluable for drawing in, pressuring, and paralyzing Cloyster throughout a match, which is essential to Sandslash's success.

Format: NU
Overview: Sandslash is able to carve out a small niche in NU as the only fully evolved Ground-type that possesses Swords Dance and a neutrality to Earthquake. Thanks to its immunity to Thunder Wave, Sandslash can switch in more easily than other Swords Dance users, like Kingler and Pinsir, by predicting Thunder Wave from Pokemon like Electrode, Drowzee, and Mr. Mime. It further benefits from the coveted Earthquake + Rock Slide combination, alongside other key offensive moves like Substitute and Body Slam. Its Speed tier is also serviceable enough to outspeed key staples like Golem, Clefable, and Porygon. Lastly, Sandslash possesses good physical bulk, allowing it to combat physical attackers like Golem effectively. With paralysis support from Pokemon like Mr. Mime and Clefable, Sandslash can ravage the opposing team late-game.
However, while having some use, Sandslash's Speed tier is still poor: the relevant Water-types of the tier, such as Kingler, Blastoise, Seadra, and Kabutops, will outspeed it, threatening significant damage before it can set up with Swords Dance. Ergo, they must be removed, severely weakened, or crippled for Sandslash to be effective. This usually causes it to rely on paralysis support, which many teams cannot afford to easily provide. Although Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave, paralysis from Body Slam, Stun Spore, or Glare cripples its chances to sweep late-game, exposing its poor special bulk and cutting into what Speed it does have. Lastly, it faces heavy competition as a Ground-type from Nidoking and Golem: the former has a much more flexible movepool, better Speed, and a Toxic immunity, while the latter has access to STAB Rock Slide, an important resistance to Fire, more immediate power, and Explosion.
Comments: 
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Swords Dance is Sandslash's calling card, driving its Attack stat to terrifying levels. At +2, it can threaten OHKOs on Pokemon like Electrode, Mr. Mime, and Nidoking with Earthquake. Rock Slide complements Earthquake, providing unresisted coverage and securing OHKOs on Charizard and Moltres after a boost; it also hits Pinsir and Fearow hard. Body Slam discourages switch-ins from Poliwhirl and Blastoise, potentially paralyzing them. Alternatively, Substitute can exploit predicted switches and grants Sandslash more opportunities to set up, especially given its immunity to Thunder Wave.
Sandslash has a surprisingly interesting movepool, making it quite customizable. Slash gives Sandslash immediate power and tears through Pokemon relying on Reflect, such as Abra and rare variants of Mr. Mime, Clefable, and Wigglytuff. Toxic prevents partial trappers like AgiliWrap Dragonair, Charizard, Moltres, and Rapidash from pinning it down. Submission is its best option against Clefable, Porygon, and Wigglytuff; however, the recoil, shaky accuracy, and lower damage than Earthquake against neutral targets make it a niche option at best. Hyper Beam is Sandslash's best move against Exeggcute and matches Earthquake’s power but fails to notably hit other targets.
As a result of its typing and good physical bulk, Sandslash can pivot in against Electrode and Golem as well as Pokemon running Rest, such as Moltres and Blastoise, which let it also break holes in the opposition with Swords Dance. Since they let Sandslash set up, sleeping Pokemon are effectively left on the sidelines until it is eliminated. Pokemon carrying Thunderbolt, like Clefable, that can deter Water-types like Seadra and Blastoise from staying in allows Sandslash to set up more easily. Chip damage from Fire Spin users like Moltres, Rapidash, and Charizard, as well as Wrap from Dragonair, is also appreciated to help secure OHKOs after a Swords Dance, which makes Sandslash more difficult to deal with over the course of a game. Lastly, paralysis support from the likes of Electrode and Mr. Mime allows Sandslash to not only have more setup opportunities, but also to fish for full paralysis with Substitute and become even more lethal.

Overview: Sandslash falls into a strange spot in RBY PU. Since Nidoqueen is very common, it can be difficult to envision where Sandslash fits on a team, but its excellent Attack, physical bulk, and superior typing give it a distinct role and matchup spread. While Sandslash isn't a replacement for Nidoqueen, it can check foes that take advantage of Nidoqueen's lower damage output or hit it super effectively due to its terrible Poison typing, like Gastly, Porygon, Machamp, Graveler, Abra, and Drowzee. Gastly in particular is a notable matchup; Nidoqueen takes massive damage from Gastly's Psychic, but it only 4HKOes Sandslash. Sandslash also punishes Porygon's passivity; Porygon's Psychic is unlikely to break Substitute, and Sandslash can set up in front of it to break past its recovery and claim a KO. Sandslash's bulk also allows it to fight Fearow and Scyther effectively, much like Nidoqueen. Sandslash also counters Magneton, of course, letting it fill in for several of Nidoqueen's roles while improving matchups against foes with Psychic- and Ground-type moves.
Unfortunately for Sandslash, most of the foes it checks effectively are somewhat niche or rarely seen, making its unique matchup spread wasted in most matches; the more common targets that it checks are also checked by Nidoqueen. Against typical foes, Sandslash's main flaws are its mediocre Speed and Special. It unfortunately struggles against Nidoqueen and Pinsir due to the Speed disadvantage, and many Water-types, such as Staryu and Seaking, also outrun it and threaten painful super effective attacks. Its Attack, while excellent, falls just short of some crucial benchmarks like 2HKOing Fearow, Porygon, and Dragonair, so a sweep is extremely unlikely without immense paralysis support and multiple turns of setup. It also struggles against Fire-types, since they outspeed it and threaten heavy damage and burn. That said, Sandslash does not need to set up to deal effective damage, and its combination of wallbreaking potential and ability to punish passivity with Swords Dance can create difficult games for the opponent. Sandslash, therefore, can fill a role over Nidoqueen on teams that need a Ground-type without the terrible weaknesses afforded by Poison typing, and it can be used over Graveler on teams where its Speed and setup opportunities are more beneficial. However, Sandslash is rare for a reason, and the other Ground-types have broader applicability.
Comments: Other Options
Sandslash generally lacks other move choices. Slash can be used to cover for pivot attempts and can be used over Swords Dance or Substitute. Body Slam can be used instead of Substitute to fish for paralysis, but it deals relatively poor damage. Hyper Beam initially seems appealing, but Ground-resistant foes like Pinsir and Fearow are weak to Rock Slide anyway, so Sandslash has no reason to take this risk.
Checks and Counters
Water-types: Sandslash is outsped by Staryu and Seaking, which nearly OHKO it and can survive an Earthquake. Seaking can even set up Agility in front of Sandslash and still win the matchup. Staryu is frail, however, and cannot switch into a healthy Sandslash and win. While Omanyte cannot beat Sandslash one-on-one, it still deals heavy damage and can easily put Sandslash in range of any revenge killer.
Nidoqueen: Nidoqueen outspeeds and 2HKOes Sandslash, which cannot OHKO Nidoqueen without a critical hit. Sandslash is capable of winning the matchup if it sets up Substitute or Swords Dance, however.
Dragonair: Dragonair outspeeds Sandslash and can chip it into range of other threats quickly with Wrap; two or three cycles of Wrap are generally enough to put it in range of Water-types, and a few more cycles put it in range of various Blizzard users, including Dragonair itself. Wrap also allows Dragonair to incentivize a set-up Sandslash to switch out to preserve its health, frustrating its attempt to make progress.
Faster Foes: Sandslash struggles with most faster foes, as it only tenuously wins these matchups and is vulnerable to critical hits and burns. Arcanine and Rapidash both have a 38.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash, which is exacerbated by their high critical hit chances and Fire Blast's burn chance. Magmar fares better with a 76.2% chance to 2HKO Sandslash, but Sandslash has a 43.6% chance to OHKO it in return; while this is a little better for Sandslash, it's still favorable for Magmar overall. Pinsir has a 53% chance to 3HKO Sandslash with Slash, and it can potentially use Bind or Hyper Beam to boost its odds; Sandslash can only 3HKO it in return with Rock Slide. Fearow cannot 3HKO Sandslash outright, but its excellent critical hit rate gives it passable odds to get lucky and win anyway, since Sandslash can only 3HKO it. All of these foes can also revenge kill Sandslash once it takes a hit or two.
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Set Description
Earthquake is Sandslash's main attacking option, as the only Pokemon that don't mind it—Fearow, Scyther, and Pinsir—are vulnerable to Rock Slide. After a Swords Dance, Sandslash deals immense damage, notably OHKOing every Fire- and Rock-type as well as Nidoqueen, Scyther, Staryu, and Drowzee; in fact, Sandslash 2HKOes or OHKOes every single Pokemon in the tier after a boost. Swords Dance also helps in some rare scenarios by reapplying Speed and Attack drops from paralysis and burn, respectively, as well as cancelling out burn on Sandslash if it happens to get burned. Substitute helps to facilitate setup and exploit switches or full paralysis, permitting Sandslash to use Swords Dance or begin attacking; since Sandslash is immune to Thunder Wave and deals heavy damage to common sleepers, it becomes extremely difficult to stop once safely behind a Substitute. If Sandslash is able to set up both Swords Dance and Substitute, it becomes nearly impossible to stop.
Sandslash generally functions as a mid-game attacker, exploiting Thunder Wave and Thunderbolt attempts from Gastly, Magneton, Drowzee, Abra, and Porygon to find entry then following up with Earthquake. Sandslash reliably beats both Psychic-types one-on-one, and Porygon cannot afford to trade hits with Sandslash, as its best-case scenario still leaves it too chipped to avoid a revenge kill; Porygon also often does not run Blizzard, leaving it with inadequate options to damage Sandslash. Gastly and Magneton, of course, are helpless against Sandslash; Gastly's Psychic is a mere 4HKO, leaving it imperiled when Sleep Clause is active, and Magneton has no good options to hit Sandslash, which can easily set up Substitute in front of it. Since Pinsir is rare and neither Fearow nor Scyther can beat Sandslash one-on-one, Sandslash can afford to simply use Earthquake and expect to make decent progress. Sandslash can also duel Fearow late-game to clear the way for teammates to finish the game. Sandslash, therefore, benefits from teammates that can spread paralysis and incentivize opposing Thunder Wave, such as Staryu and Porygon. It also appreciates allies that can chip down faster checks for it; Nidoqueen and Seaking, for example, can help to weaken Fearow and Fire-types for Sandslash to finish off later. Dragonair is notable for its combination of Thunder Wave and Wrap, which can paralyze checks on entry then grant Sandslash a free switch-in.

Overview: Scyther has an array of applicable offensive tools in the NU metagame. Slash bypasses Pokemon relying on Reflect, such as Abra and some Clefable variants, while Swords Dance and Hyper Beam make it tough for Normal-neutral Pokemon to switch into. Scyther is also one of the fastest unboosted Pokemon in the metagame; it ties for the second-fastest Pokemon in the tier with Rapidash and has a superb critical hit ratio of 20.5%. Its already terrific Speed can be bolstered with Agility, meaning it cannot be pinned down by partial trappers and opposing Agility users like Dragonair and Moltres either. With adequate paralysis support and good prediction, Scyther can theoretically be used as a powerful late-game cleaner.
However, Scyther has too many flaws to warrant a spot on most teams. Its low bulk and horrid defensive typing render many attackers able to 2HKO or even OHKO it. These include notable Pokemon such as Blastoise, Nidoking, Golem, and Kingler. Scyther's reliance on Speed means that even with Agility, it is severely debilitated by paralysis compared to other sweepers. It also has a barren movepool: besides the miserably weak Wing Attack, it only possesses Normal-type attacks, meaning Rock-types like Golem and Kabutops can easily switch in and make progress against it. Other fast sweepers, such as Mr. Mime and Electrode, can provide more offensive presence throughout matches, as they sport better coverage moves and provide utility with status moves like Thunder Wave. While Scyther can be used to lure its counters and grant switch-in opportunities for its teammates like Blastoise and Kingler, this tends to be prediction-reliant and inconsistent.
Comments: 
Moveset: Double Dance
Description: Swords Dance makes Scyther's Hyper Beam one of the most threatening moves in the tier, always or possibly OHKOing Pokemon like Mr. Mime, Electrode, and Rapidash at +2. Agility allows it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame, notably including Electrode and Rapidash, which usually threaten it out with super effective moves. If Scyther is paralyzed, Agility can also remove the Speed drop. Slash is its primary attacking move, almost always scoring a critical hit and punishing foes for switching into predicted Swords Dance, 3HKOing foes like Charizard, Poliwhirl, and Ninetales. Unfortunately, it does not get a power boost with Swords Dance.
Scyther's shallow movepool leaves it with few other options. Agility is the most replaceable, as Scyther is already fast and does not need the additional Speed most of the time. Toxic discourages AgiliWrap Dragonair and Fire Spin users like Moltres, Charizard, and Rapidash from setting up on it. Unlike Slash, Double-Edge gets the power boost from Swords Dance and can be utilized if Slash's immediate power is not desired. Wing Attack can be used to damage Gastly, but not only is Gastly rare, Wing Attack also has lower damage than Slash even against super effective targets. Substitute can be used to ease prediction, rack up poison and burn damage, and fish for full paralysis and misses, such as against Fire-types like Charizard, Ninetales, and Moltres.
As Scyther struggles to make headway against Rock-types like Kabutops and Golem, Grass-types like Exeggcute and Weepinbell are useful teammates. Scyther is also vulnerable to Fire-types like Ninetales, Rapidash, and Moltres, so Water-types like Kabutops and Blastoise to withstand Fire- and Rock-type attacks are also appreciated. Scyther can function as a lure for Rock-type Pokemon, which makes it easier for its partners like Blastoise and Kingler to predict an attack. Sleep inducers such as Poliwhirl and Venomoth can cripple Scyther’s counters and can facilitate setup opportunities. In turn, Scyther can come in on predicted Rest from Pokemon like Poliwhirl and Blastoise, enabling it to more easily break through the opposition.

Overview: Scyther's incredible Speed—tied with Rapidash for the fastest in the tier—makes it one of only two Pokemon that outspeeds the ubiquitous Fearow, giving it a near-unique ability to revenge kill it. Scyther's excellent Speed is complemented by a fantastic Attack stat and access to Slash. It can further increase its attacking prowess with the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam; with just one boost, it's capable of outright OHKOing many of the tier's frailer Pokemon, such as Staryu and Drowzee. With two boosts, it becomes near-unstoppable, as its high Speed also makes it extremely difficult to revenge kill. However, Scyther is held back by its terrible coverage and a subpar typing. Scyther's offensive movepool is limited to Normal-type moves and the extremely weak Wing Attack, meaning it is completely walled by Graveler and Omanyte, and it also has trouble breaking through Gastly unboosted. Although Scyther's typing gifts it with a handy immunity to Ground-type moves, every Earthquake user has a move that hits it super effectively. Scyther is also weak to the common Fire-type moves in the tier; notably, Rapidash and Arcanine have a 61.5% chance to OHKO it with Fire Blast. Lastly, Scyther's power falls just short of some crucial damage thresholds. For example, Scyther's Hyper Beam at +2 Attack is unable to OHKO Arcanine, Magneton, and Seaking, and it can only OHKO Fearow 30.8% of the time; additionally, Slash followed by a +2 Hyper Beam isn't a guaranteed KO on Nidoqueen. Scyther also faces competition from Pinsir; although they have different roles on a team, they are often incompatible due to their shared weaknesses, most notably to the common Fire Blast. Scyther boasts higher Speed, while Pinsir has higher physical bulk and power, allowing it to get the damage thresholds that Scyther barely misses out on.
Comments: Other Options
If Scyther pursues other options, Wing Attack should be dropped, although it is usually not recommended due to completely losing the Gastly matchup. Scyther's most common other option is Agility; it can be used to negate the Speed drop from paralysis. This increases the pool of Pokemon that Scyther can set up on, adding foes such as Staryu, Drowzee, and Vileplume to its list of options. This can also be used to win certain endgames that Scyther would otherwise lose by taking paralysis. However, the chance for full paralysis reduces Hyper Beam's accuracy to an effective 67.1%, and considering Scyther typically has to hit multiple Hyper Beams in a row, this sweep can be halted by one unfortunate miss or full paralysis. In addition, Agility can be used to outpace other Agility users, such as Seaking, Dragonair, and Porygon, while also allowing Scyther to not worry about speed ties against opposing Scyther or Rapidash.
Substitute can be used to punish switches, such as a weakened Fearow switching out of a predicted Slash, but Scyther can still be paralyzed behind a Substitute. Double-Edge can be used as a midground between Slash and Hyper Beam but it is only useful in highly specific situations and is generally not recommended.
Checks and Counters
Rock-types: Graveler and Omanyte can switch into all of Scyther's attacks and wall it. The former takes up to 17.8% from Slash and OHKOes with Rock Slide, while the latter takes up to 22.7% from Slash and 2HKOes with Blizzard. Graveler can also freely set up Substitute on Scyther, making it very tricky to switch into.
Gastly: Gastly is completely immune to Slash and Hyper Beam, and it 2HKOes Scyther with Thunderbolt. Scyther has to rely on the weak Wing Attack to hit Gastly, which does very little when unboosted. However, the move 2HKOes at +2 Attack, meaning Gastly has to hit Hypnosis if it switches into Scyther as it uses Swords Dance, but it can use Thunderbolt instead to get Scyther into KO range for a teammate. Even at +4 Attack, Scyther fails to OHKO Gastly most of the time.
Fire-types: Arcanine and Rapidash have a 61.5% chance to OHKO Scyther with Fire Blast; Arcanine always survives a +2 Hyper Beam and Rapidash survives 84.6% of the time. Magmar has higher odds to OHKO Scyther with an 82.1% chance, but Scyther also has an 82.1% chance to OHKO Magmar at +2 Attack, meaning Magmar is better suited for checking an unboosted Scyther.
Magneton: Magneton has a 79.5% chance to OHKO Scyther with Thunderbolt and always survives +2 Hyper Beam, making it an effective switch-in. It also threatens Thunder Wave to stop Scyther from sweeping even if it manages to survive a hit.
Paralysis: Since Scyther is heavily reliant on its Speed, it must avoid paralysis, especially if it lacks Agility. A paralyzed Scyther is very easy to revenge kill due to its poor bulk and weakness-laden typing. Because of this, it should switch out of Thunder Wave users such as Staryu and Drowzee unless it can KO them. Thunder Wave variants of Porygon are overwhelmingly favored to survive a +2 Hyper Beam, and they cleanly 2HKO Scyther with Blizzard. Vileplume's bulk also lets it survive a +2 Hyper Beam from full HP, although it has to rely on the less accurate Stun Spore.
Ground-types: Nidoqueen and Sandslash are bulky enough to beat Scyther one-on-one. They both easily survive a +2 Hyper Beam and 2HKO Scyther in return. However, Scyther can pair up with other physical attackers checked by them, such as Fearow, to break through, overwhelming these checks with offensive power.
Moveset: Swords Dance Sweeper
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Scyther boasts the deadly combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam, which allows it to set up and sweep an opposing team. Scyther needs to set up on Pokemon that are unable to paralyze or OHKO it, such as Fearow, Nidoqueen, Pinsir, Machamp, unboosted Seaking, and Gastly. Unfortunately, Scyther fails to KO many of these foes at +2 Attack, meaning they must be weakened first. As such, setting up with Scyther often requires baiting one of these Pokemon in, dealing enough damage to put it in KO range of Scyther's +2 Hyper Beam, and then allowing your own Pokemon to faint so Scyther may enter the field safely. At this point, Scyther can use Swords Dance, take a hit, and potentially sweep. Arguably the most important Pokemon that Scyther can set up on Fearow, since its high Speed makes it otherwise difficult to check offensively. However, Scyther must be wary of an OHKO from Fearow's Drill Peck on a critical hit.
Slash is a very good option for Scyther if it is unable to find a turn to set up. It can KO frailer Pokemon such as Drowzee and Staryu from 51% and 56.6%, respectively. Most importantly, it does a minimum of 41.1% to Fearow, which is enough to KO Fearow after Nidoqueen or Seaking's Blizzard, and it is favored to KO after Gastly's Thunderbolt. This gives Scyther a safer option to revenge kill Fearow without risking the OHKO from a critical hit Drill Peck. Wing Attack allows Scyther to hit Gastly, notably 2HKOing it at +2 Attack. This means if Gastly switches into Scyther as it sets up Swords Dance, it has to land Hypnosis in order to beat Scyther. If Sleep Clause is already active, the odds become even better for Scyther, as Gastly has to fish for either a critical hit or paralysis from Thunderbolt.
Scyther fits best on fast offensive teams that appreciate its Speed and ability to revenge kill Fearow. Seaking is a good teammate that can switch into Fire-types and Graveler. Seaking's Blizzard also gets Fearow into KO range for Scyther's Slash. Porygon can switch into Graveler and Omanyte to wall them and set up Agility. Porygon's Psychic also gets Gastly into KO range for Scyther's Wing Attack at +2. Sleepers such as Gastly, Drowzee, and Vileplume can help Scyther find setup opportunities on sleeping Pokemon. Fire-type allies can trade with opposing Fire-types and Gastly to ease pressure for Scyther. Scyther also fits well on hyper offensive teams that sacrifice utility Pokemon in favor of damage output, as it benefits a lot more from foes being at low HP than from them being paralyzed. As a result, Pokemon such as Nidoqueen, Rapidash, Arcanine, Pinsir, and Machamp are good teammates. It is possible to drop Nidoqueen on these teams as well, since teams lacking Nidoqueen generally focus on stacking Pokemon with high Speed, and Scyther can alleviate the Fearow weakness that a team lacking Nidoqueen often suffers.

Format: NU
Overview: Seadra is a potent attacker and late-game Agility sweeper in RBY NU that also happens to match up well against many "Big 5"—Mr. Mime, Clefable, Blastoise, Charizard, and Venomoth—structures, as these teams often use Nidoking, Golem, or Kabutops as their sixth Pokemon, all of which lose to Seadra. Seadra Speed ties Nidoking and outruns much of the tier, giving it solid matchups against most slower foes, and it can bypass paralysis with Agility to help against foes like Clefable and Wigglytuff. It's also one of the best Pokemon against a late-game Charizard sweep, as it survives a +2 Hyper Beam with ease. Seadra's passable bulk and high Special let it duel much of the tier and relieve some pressure from Blastoise, which is often stretched thin checking opposing Blastoise and Charizard. Thus, it can serve as a mid-game attacker and pivot to free up Blastoise—assuming the opposing Blastoise is put to sleep or otherwise handled—or it can act as a late-game cleaner, allowing players to use Blastoise heavily early-game and follow up with Seadra to close out the game.
However, Seadra struggles horribly against the ubiquitous Blastoise, which it can only 5HKO with the inaccurate Hydro Pump, and Kingler, which it rarely 3HKOes with Hydro Pump or 4HKOes with Surf, but Kingler can easily set up Swords Dance and retaliate for massive damage. Seadra's Speed is great, but it's still outsped by Mr. Mime, Raticate, and Electrode, all of which usually beat it one-on-one; Venomoth also outspeeds it and can put it to sleep. While Seadra easily beats many foes one-on-one, it cannot switch into them; Nidoking and Kabutops beat Seadra if it has to switch into them, and Golem deals a big chunk of damage with Earthquake as well.
Comments: Other Options
Seadra has few notable other options. Toxic can help it damage Blastoise, but unless it lands Toxic as Blastoise switches in, this is relatively ineffective; also, since Toxic turns to normal poison after switching out, the foe may be able to preserve Blastoise and send something else to finish off Seadra after a Seismic Toss or two. Smokescreen allows Seadra to fish for misses and can be combined with Toxic, but this is extremely luck-based and unlikely to work. Hyper Beam deals slightly more damage than Surf to Mr. Mime, but it's rarely worth the moveslot over Hydro Pump, which outdamages both moves without the drawback. It also can finish off Blastoise, but it deals a minimum of 23%, so it's only a little better than Hydro Pump. Blizzard is the best move to drop for Hyper Beam, as Exeggcute and Fearow are rare.
Checks and Counters
Blastoise: Blastoise completely shuts down Seadra, which does almost no damage to it. Worse still, Seismic Toss 4HKOes Seadra, 3HKOing it after slight chip damage, so Blastoise easily wins the matchup and is difficult to switch into. Blastoise can also safely fish for Body Slam paralysis twice and still 4HKO Seadra, so switching becomes even less safe.
Electrode: Electrode outspeeds Seadra and 2HKOes it, and its massive critical hit rate only skews the matchup further. Seadra can only rarely 2HKO Electrode with Hydro Pump, so even a healthy Seadra with Agility set up will usually lose.
Thunderbolt Users: Mr. Mime and Clefable both can beat or, at worst, heavily damage Seadra; Mr. Mime outspeeds and tenuously 2HKOes it with Thunderbolt, while Clefable is slower and 3HKOes it. However, Seadra has poor odds to 2HKO Mr. Mime with Hydro Pump and will usually need to hit Hydro Pump at least twice followed by a Surf to 3HKO Clefable. Clefable is a weaker check, as Seadra is faster and has better odds to win the matchup, but any chip damage puts the matchup squarely in Clefable's favor.
Venomoth: Venomoth outspeeds Seadra and can put it to sleep, preventing it from making much progress early-game. Seadra can only 3HKO Venomoth, so it's unlikely to avoid sleep.
Kingler: Kingler usually stops Seadra but is unable to switch into it. Kingler can set up on Seadra and KO it with +2 Body Slam followed by Hyper Beam, while Seadra can only 4HKO Kingler with Surf or 3HKO it with Hydro Pump 37% of the time, which is effectively a mere 19% chance after accounting for accuracy.
Moveset: Agility Sweeper
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Surf and Blizzard hit all targets except opposing Water-types— Surf 2HKOes Charizard, Ninetales, Nidoking, and Raticate, and it rarely 2HKOes Moltres, while Blizzard 2HKOes Exeggcute and Fearow. Hydro Pump 2HKOes Kabutops and gives Seadra the extra damage needed to KO Moltres after a Surf; it also gives it a chance to 2HKO Mr. Mime and Electrode and helps secure the 3HKO on Venomoth. Agility allows Seadra to shrug off paralysis and outspeed threats like Mr. Mime, Nidoking, and Charizard; if Seadra sets it up before securing a KO, it can land an extra hit or two before going down. Agility also enables it to sweep late-game against weakened teams after setting up against foes like Nidoking and Golem or against Fire-types.
Seadra's typical gameplan is to wait for Blastoise to be removed, often by trading one's own Blastoise for it, then looking for an opportunity to get in against a slower foe and take it out. Against foes it cleanly 2HKOes, it can often set up Agility, allowing it to not only defeat the foe in front of it but also land an extra hit against revenge killers like Electrode, Mr. Mime, and Charizard. Similarly, it can be saved to clean up late-game, setting up Agility in front of a weakened foe and then tearing through its chipped opposition. If faster threats have been paralyzed, Seadra can win outright without setup; a paralyzed Charizard is no threat to it, and a paralyzed Mr. Mime will often fail to 2HKO it.
Seadra is best used alongside other Water-types, like Blastoise and Kingler, to help overwhelm opposing Thunderbolt users and check Charizard. It exploits Ground-type Pokemon that are often used to protect their teammates from an Electrode sweep and should be used on teams looking for extra insurance against these threats, since Blastoise has a hard time with Nidoking and is already overtasked with checking opposing Charizard and Blastoise. Most teams with Seadra are extremely weak to Electrode, as they usually have Charizard and Blastoise as well. Charizard can be dropped for a Ground-type to cover this weakness. Seadra also easily pivots into Blizzard from Clefable or Nidoking and duels them, helping to protect Ground-type allies. Blastoise completely walls Seadra, so teams that can overwhelm Blastoise with attackers like Electrode, Nidoking, and Kingler help to enable it. Sleep inducers, like Venomoth and Exeggcute, can help to remove checks like Blastoise and Mr. Mime and spread paralysis to further enable Seadra.

It is capable of blasting through many of PU's top Pokemon, such as Nidoqueen, Fearow, and Arcanine, as well as other common foes such as Rapidash, Scyther, and Graveler. Seaking's Water typing is also fantastic defensively, blessing it with important resistances to the common Fire- and Water-type attacks in the tier. Notably, it has few practical weaknesses; Magneton is the only common Pokemon to threaten Seaking with a super effective STAB move. Additionally, Seaking's defenses are high enough to fend off neutral attacks with relative ease. For example, it is only KOed by Fearow's Double-Edge followed up by Hyper Beam 29.8% of the time, and it always lives Scyther's Hyper Beam at +2. Furthermore, Seaking avoids a 2HKO from every non-STAB Thunderbolt user with the exception of Gastly, which only has a 10.7% chance to 2HKO. Seaking's excellent defensive profile means it can find many opportunities to set up Agility to alleviate its low Speed, and once it is set up, it is very hard to stop if its foe doesn't have the proper tools to take it down.
Despite all of its positive traits, Seaking is held back by some poor matchups that prevent it from effortlessly sweeping. The most prominent of these matchups is Staryu; an unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking and completely wall it barring critical hits. Gastly can also switch into Surf once per game and threaten it with both Thunderbolt and Hypnosis. Both Staryu and Gastly are very hard to switch into, so Seaking inviting them in for free can result in a huge loss of momentum. One less common but still dangerous foe that switches into Seaking is Magneton, which only takes up to 30.6% from Surf and threatens Seaking with Thunderbolt. These poor matchups mean that Seaking is typically reserved for the late-game, after its teammates wear down its checks. However, Seaking is lethal to unprepared teams, and the threat of a Seaking sweep should always be considered when building a team and in battle.
Comments: Other Options
Other options are generally not recommended on Seaking. It can drop Surf and use a set consisting of Agility, Blizzard, Double-Edge, and Hyper Beam in order to handle both Fearow and Staryu, but it makes Seaking much worse against Fire-types and Gastly. Rest can be used to win one-on-one against opposing Seaking and in certain endgames against opposing Fire-types, but it is very easy to punish and seldom worth a moveslot. Seaking can also be a lead, as it matches up well against the two most common leads—Arcanine and Nidoqueen—but it typically invites Gastly and Staryu in early. However, this can also be exploited to pivot into a teammate such as Arcanine or Abra.
Checks and Counters
Water-types: Staryu is without a doubt Seaking’s biggest counter. An unparalyzed Staryu can switch into Seaking then use Recover until it KOes itself from Double-Edge recoil. If Seaking uses Hyper Beam or Agility, Staryu can then paralyze it safely and continue to use Recover until it fully paralyzes. Seaking is also able to switch into itself well, and the face-off will typically result in the winning Seaking being at low enough HP that something can revenge kill it, although it will probably be able to fire off one more attack before being KOed if it set up Agility.
Gastly: Gastly outspeeds Seaking, is immune to its Normal-type moves, and can threaten threaten Seaking with Thunderbolt or Hypnosis. However, it is harder for Gastly to switch into Seaking at +2, as a critical hit Surf into Surf KOes Gastly.
Magneton: Magneton outspeeds Seaking, is 4HKOed by Surf, and 2HKOes in return with Thunderbolt. Magneton can also use Thunder, which has a 61.4% chance to OHKO Seaking.
Porygon: Porygon is able to threaten paralysis while using Recover to heal off any damage it takes. Porygon can also use Agility to reapply the Speed drop from paralysis, making it harder for Seaking to push through the Speed drop with Agility. Switching directly into an attack from Seaking is risky, though, as a critical hit Surf into Hyper Beam is guaranteed to KO Porygon.
Water-resistant Foes: Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Dragonair, and even if Seaking is running Blizzard it’s still outsped and can be worn down with Wrap. Similarly, Seaking without Blizzard is helpless against Vileplume, giving it a good opportunity to come in and use Sleep Powder.
Magmar: Although it is 2HKOed by Surf, Magmar is much better at handling Seaking compared to Arcanine and Rapidash. It outspeeds Seaking and can use either Confuse Ray or Smokescreen to give Seaking difficulty setting up, and Psychic's chance for a Special drop can severely weaken Seaking. Notably, Magmar avoids a 2HKO from Surf if it is able to drop Seaking's Special before its first attack.
Moveset: Agility
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Surf is Seaking's strongest STAB move and hits a huge chunk of the tier super effectively, OHKOing Graveler and 2HKOing Nidoqueen, Arcanine, Rapidash, and Magmar. It 3HKOes most neutral targets as well, including Fearow, Gastly, and Porygon 95.1% of the time. Agility allows Seaking to function as a deadly sweeper. At +2, Seaking outspeeds every unboosted foe, letting it take advantage of its excellent attacking power. It also negates the Speed drop from paralysis, which allows Seaking to more easily set up on Fire-types that try to hit it with Body Slam. Seaking is also able to set up on Nidoqueen, Fearow, and Scyther. Hyper Beam is most commonly used to blast through Staryu; it does a minimum of 55.1%, and a critical hit Hyper Beam OHKOes Staryu. It also does more damage than Surf to Porygon, Drowzee, and Abra. Notably, a critical hit Surf puts Porygon into Hyper Beam range, but not Surf range. Blizzard 2HKOes Fearow and Scyther; Blizzard into Surf is also heavily favored to KO Fearow and pretty much guaranteed to KO Scyther. Blizzard is also able to hit Vileplume and Dragonair super-effectively, but these foes aren't very common. Alternatively, Seaking can equip Double-Edge to break through Staryu. Double-Edge into Hyper Beam has a 54.3% chance to KO it, but Staryu's access to Recover means Double-Edge is only effective at breaking through Staryu once it's paralyzed or if Seaking has already used Agility.
Seaking should be saved for the late-game after Staryu and to a lesser extent Gastly and Magneton are accounted for. Once all of its threats are neutralized, Seaking is free to come in and attempt to sweep. It should have no trouble finding an opportunity to set up; it is able to set up Agility on Nidoqueen, Fearow, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Scyther. Once Seaking is set up, it can outright sweep or severely damage an opposing team to the point where its teammates can clean up. However, this may not always happen in practice, and sometimes Seaking is forced into its bad matchups. If the opponent still has a Gastly or Magneton remaining, it may be worth sacrificing Seaking for damage on these foes; two hits from Surf gets Magneton into guaranteed KO range of Fearow's Hyper Beam and Gastly into KO range of most of the tier, doing up to 80.6%. Against a healthy Staryu, Seaking is best off using Agility to outspeed it then fishing for a critical hit Hyper Beam, as Staryu can paralyze Seaking and use Recover to stall out Double-Edge. If Seaking has Blizzard, it is best to fish for a freeze first, then go for the Hyper Beam once it is in KO range from Staryu's Thunderbolt.
Seaking's best teammates are ones that can wear down its checks early-game to enable it later. Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine are all able to deal heavy damage to Seaking's strongest checks, Staryu and Gastly. All three have Agility to negate the Speed drop from Staryu's Thunder Wave, and the latter two can paralyze Staryu with Body Slam. In return, Seaking supports them by taking on opposing Fire-types, Nidoqueen, and Graveler, giving them great offensive synergy. Magneton is able to OHKO Staryu, making it a good teammate. Abra and Magmar also have good matchups against Staryu and Gastly, but their lack of Agility makes them more vulnerable to paralysis. Porygon is also an excellent teammate that can bait in Staryu and Gastly and paralyze them, making them easier for Seaking to handle later. Porygon, Magneton, Gastly and Staryu can also help handle opposing Seaking, which can otherwise trade hits with your own Seaking. Nidoqueen is also a good teammate that completely walls Magneton and functions as a Staryu lure; it sacrifices itself for damage on Staryu to make it easy for a teammate like Fearow to revenge kill. Graveler is also a great teammate that walls Magneton while also luring in Staryu. Although Staryu OHKOes Graveler, it will be in KO range from Fearow and the Fire-types if it switched into Earthquake, and Staryu cannot safely use Recover against Graveler due to the threat of Explosion.

Format: Tradebacks OU
Overview: With the addition of Swords Dance into its movepool, Seaking manages to function as a competent setup sweeper. With STAB Surf as an added bonus, it also blasts through common Hyper Beam switch-ins, such as Rhydon. Agility distinguishes Seaking from its competing Swords Dance users, as, even when paralyzed, it still poses a threat to sweep if the opposing team has been damaged. Once set up, Seaking can be a difficult Pokemon to stop, KOing frailer Pokemon such as Persian and Jolteon from over 75% HP with Hyper Beam. Seaking is decently sturdy as well, surviving two hits from Starmie's Thunderbolt and Alakazam's Thunder Punch a significant majority of the time, giving it more opportunities to set up than Kingler.
However, Seaking has to use both Swords Dance and Agility to pose any threat to the opposition. With only Surf and a single physical attack in its attacking moveset due to this—most likely Hyper Beam or the middling Double-Edge—Seaking is not surpassingly rewarding either, struggling to break through bulky Pokemon like Reflect Chansey. It's also completely incapable of breaking through the common Gengar and is struck with Thunderbolt in return; the improved coverage of staples like Thunder Punch for Alakazam and Hypno does not help its case either. Seaking is rarely seen in Tradebacks OU by account of its committal nature and unexceptional reward, normally finding itself competing with Kingler, which, while lacking Agility, has far better damage output for the effort put in.
Comments: 
Moveset: Double Dance
Description: Swords Dance raises Seaking's Attack to acceptable levels, letting Hyper Beam land guaranteed OHKOs against Jynx and Alakazam, while Agility allows it to outrun the unboosted metagame and ignore the Speed drop from paralysis. A +2 Hyper Beam can also KO Pokemon such as Persian, Rapidash, Chansey, Jolteon, and Hypno if around 20% damage has been dealt prior. At +4, Seaking can OHKO Chansey, Hypno, Starmie, and even Tauros a third of the time. Surf covers Rock-types such as Rhydon, as well as dealing around 25% to Gengar, while also serving as an attack without a drawback.
Seaking's movepool is barren but does have other options worth exploring; generally, it should always use a Double Dance set, or it's outclassed by Pokemon like Kingler. Blizzard is a plausible alternative to Surf for the freeze chance and 3HKOing Exeggutor and Zapdos, but the damage is otherwise unimpressive and it fails to OHKO Rhydon. Double-Edge, while having less drawback than Hyper Beam, is weak enough to largely diminish Seaking's threat level once set up. Hydro Pump may seem enticing, but it isn't compatible with the event-only Swords Dance, defeating its purpose.
Seaking should commit to boosting only when it is possible to sweep. +4 Attack is needed to OHKO most Pokemon in the tier, and +2 Speed is needed to avoid being revenge killed by faster unparalyzed Pokemon. This amount of setup is daunting, but achievable. Seaking's bulk can withstand two hits from almost everything besides Razor Leaf or very strong Thunderbolts. Taking paralysis is also normally inconsequential in the process; thanks to its setup-heavy nature, Seaking is efficient as reapplying foes' Speed drops from paralysis if an opposing team has been riddled with it. Once Gengar, Electric-types, and Razor Leaf users are eliminated or confirmed to be absent, and extra-bulky Pokemon like Snorlax have taken a little damage, a single free turn can be all the opening Seaking needs to complete the three turns of setup needed to sweep. Against slower teams, Swords Dance can be all that's necessary to break through slower, bulkier Pokemon in Hypno, Chansey, and non-Reflect Snorlax variants. To achieve optimal conditions for a sweep, Seaking should be paired with consistent sleepers such as Jynx and Exeggutor, and Reflect Snorlax to check opposing Snorlax. Seaking is overwhelmed by Gengar, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electabuzz, so Jolteon can be a helpful partner to safely switch into their attacks, while Seaking in turn can check Ground-types like Rhydon in a pinch for Jolteon. Rhydon, Chansey, and Alakazam can also check these Pokemon by comfortably switching into Thunderbolt, though, depending on the coverage of those Seaking checks, these partners might struggle to consistently switch in.

Format: OU
Overview: Amnesia Slowbro has gone down in history as one of the most famous and well-known sets in the world of competitive Pokemon. Generally known as TobyBro, Amnesia Slowbro is a moveset that combines both simplicity and efficiency. The RBY version of Amnesia is arguably the best stat-boosting move of all time, raising the Special stat by two stages. It quickly powers up Slowbro's Special moves, while covering its main defensive weakness: Electric-type attacks. Having one of the best physical defense stats in the game and learning Thunder Wave to make up for its awful Speed greatly helps make Slowbro more threatening as well.
However, Slowbro is also a bit of an all-or-nothing Pokemon and requires some luck, which are the main reasons why it's often an overlooked Pokemon. Without setting up, Slowbro is basically a useless Pokemon; it can't Recover to work as a wall for a long time, and offensively, it lacks Explosion or a sleep move, unlike other specially based Pokemon. On the other hand, if Slowbro sets up, it's meant never to switch out, so the user is inevitably taking some risks; Electric-type moves fail to get past a +6 Slowbro normally, but with a critical hit, a non-STAB Thunderbolt will nearly OHKO Slowbro while a STAB Thunderbolt will OHKO outright. With critical hit rates being much higher in RBY than in later generations, it's not really "bad luck" when Slowbro ultimately ends up falling to a critical hit Thunderbolt. To a lesser extent, this can also be applied to the physical side, potentially turning 4HKOs into 3HKOs, letting a physical sweeper get past Rest. However, while it's true that Slowbro depends on quite a bit on luck, it also requires a good deal of skill, and Slowbro can be one of the most dangerous Pokemon in the first generation, being the best Amnesia user in RBY after Mewtwo.
Comments: Other Options
Ice Beam is another attacking move Slowbro can use. Its biggest upside is hitting Grass-types and Zapdos for super effective damage, including Exeggutor and Victreebel. Ice Beam will often surprise Exeggutor, OHKOing it at +6. At the very least, it will force Exeggutor to use Explosion earlier, making it more predictable. Meanwhile, Zapdos is 2HKOed by a +2 Ice Beam and OHKOed when Slowbro is at +6. Ice Beam's freeze chance might also save you in a pinch and could make a difference against another Slowbro or Amnesia Snorlax. Ice Beam, however, should only be used over Thunder Wave, because the STAB move is necessary to 2HKO Chansey and Starmie. Withdraw has the same goal as Reflect, with the difference that it can maximize Slowbro's Defense, but requires two turns to reach Reflect's potential. Reflect will generally turn out to be more useful and safer. Withdraw's high PP will let Slowbro outstall other Slowbro, however. Counter can surprise common Slowbro switch-ins like Starmie if you switch into a Body Slam from a physical attacker and scare it out, or if you predict a Hyper Beam. Counter has hardly any other uses other than these though because Slowbro generally only takes physical attacks when it's asleep, excluding Explosion. Disable is a funny option that can prevent some Pokemon from Thunderbolting Slowbro for some time, but it's very unreliable and shouldn't really be used.
Slowbro can also be used as a lead with a set of Thunder Wave, Amnesia, Surf, and Fire Blast or Blizzard. This set is incredibly vulnerable to sleep leads such as Jynx, Exeggutor, Gengar, and Sing Chansey; however, when it finds itself against other Thunder Wave leads, namely Alakazam and Starmie, its ability to boost up with Amnesia and pump out damage with +2 coverage moves is remarkable. It still struggles in doing significant damage if the opponent has Thunderbolt Chansey or Starmie anywhere on their team, and due to its lack of recovery it is incredibly easy to wear down and incredibly vulnerable to full paralysis, so this set is not recommended.
Checks and Counters
Electric-type coverage: The higher the user's critical hit ratio and the number of turns it can resist Slowbro's Surf, the better. Starmie is a good choice, having a very high Speed and thus a high critical hit ratio, while also resisting all of Slowbro's moves. It's not a surefire counter though, and in case Starmie prevails, it won't like having to eat a Thunder Wave. Gengar makes a good choice too, having a high critical hit ratio and being able to Explode for around 50% damage when it's about to be KOed. However, it doesn't resist Surf and is weak to Psychic. Zapdos and Jolteon have the luxury of getting STAB in their Electric-type attacks; even when Slowbro is at +6, their Thunderbolts will still do significant damage. They also have a high critical hit ratio, but like Gengar, they don't resist Surf, and, unlike Gengar, can't Explode.
Explosion users: Explosion makes a very viable choice for taking Slowbro down when you have no other option. No user can OHKO a healthy Slowbro, but many put it in the KO range of Tauros's Hyper Beam or Rhydon's Earthquake. Pokemon with Explosion or Self-Destruct include Exeggutor, Snorlax, Golem, Cloyster, and Gengar, although Gengar's Explosion is weaker. A Resting Slowbro that gets Exploded on is pretty much a dead Slowbro.
Strong Physical Attackers: Amnesia Snorlax will often defeat Slowbro, as its Body Slam is an almost guaranteed 4HKO while Slowbro's Surf only manages a 5HKO when both are at +6. Due to the Speed tie, a 4HKO could turn into a 3HKO, depending on who goes first the turn Slowbro uses Rest. If Snorlax is packing Thunderbolt instead, it will fare even better, 3HKOing Slowbro after both have set up. As far as the physical side goes, Rhydon makes a surprisingly viable option, although risky as well; it has to switch in when Slowbro uses Rest, and then try to 3HKO it with its STAB Earthquake, which will happen around 75-80% of the time. Tauros needs a critical hit Body Slam to get the chance to 3HKO it after finishing it off with a Hyper Beam. If Tauros gets paralyzed, though, you can pretty much forget about beating Slowbro. Snorlax's critical hit ratio is much smaller than Tauros's, but its Body Slam is almost a guaranteed 4HKO, and has an easier chance if Body Slam paralyzes Slowbro. For instance, if Snorlax moves first while Slowbro tries to use Rest, but moves last on the previous turn that Slowbro Rested, Snorlax beats Slowbro with only Body Slam. Both Tauros and physical Snorlax should really be careful when trying to counter Slowbro and should generally only be sent in when Slowbro is sleeping because they will otherwise fall to previously-boosted Surfs more often than not. If Slowbro's set contains Reflect, though, trying to counter it with physical attacks becomes impractical unless you are willing to sacrifice at least two Exploders. In this case, however, any unparalyzed Thunderbolt user becomes a much more effective check, including the slow ones, such as Chansey and Lapras, which, despite their low critical hit rate, will get more chances to fish for it, as it's much more likely that Slowbro is forced to Rest more often. Chansey and especially Starmie will get the chance to keep using their recovery move until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed, which is when they get the chance to use Thunderbolt. Starmie is much better at doing this because Recover outlasts Surf in terms of PP.
Razor Leaf users: Victreebel and Venusaur are known for having a guaranteed critical hit in their STAB signature move, Razor Leaf. They won't like switching into a Thunder Wave, and could be surprised and OHKOed by a boosted STAB Psychic, but, otherwise, either of the Grass-types can KO Slowbro when it is below 70% or 2HKO it while it is Resting.
Light Screen users: Starmie or Chansey packing Light Screen will completely counter Slowbro unless they get really unlucky with full paralysis. Light Screen is never seen on them, however, as it has no use outside of walling Slowbro.
Pressure: It's worth noting that Slowbro, as a Rest user, is one of those Pokemon that should be attacked whenever given the chance, because when it's Resting, you can apply a much higher and more effective variety of tactics to try to take it down. Exeggutor's Mega Drain and Alakazam and Jynx's Seismic Toss, for instance, may not do enough to kill Slowbro, but will cause some decent damage on it before being forced to switch out, which will force it to Rest earlier than desired.
Moveset: TobyBro (Amnesia)
Description: Everybody knows the set, but this doesn't make it less dangerous. Amnesia boosts Slowbro's decent Special, being able to reach the maximum 999 after three Amnesia boosts, letting Slowbro 2HKO Chansey with its STAB Surf at +6. Amnesia, like all boosting moves, also has the great side effect of further reducing the speed of paralyzed enemies, allowing Slowbro to muscle through paralyzed would-be walls a lot more easily. When playing Slowbro, it's really useful to know some significant damage rolls or otherwise have a damage calculator handy. As said, Slowbro has a good chance of 2HKOing Chansey but must be at +6. The same can be said about Starmie, although a 999 Special STAB Surf is a guaranteed 2HKO. On the other hand, Starmie is much more of a problem for Slowbro due to having a much higher critical hit ratio. Beating Tauros is about using Amnesia once and then 2HKOing it with Surf, although a +4 Slowbro stands a good chance of OHKOing Tauros. Snorlax, however, requires Slowbro to use Amnesia twice to get the 2HKO; a +6 Surf almost never OHKOes Snorlax. Zapdos also requires two Amnesia boosts, while Jolteon, like Tauros, is 2HKOed by a +2 Surf. Gengar will fall to two +2 Surfs half of the time, so it's generally advised to only use Amnesia once. Exeggutor and Lapras are 3HKOed by a +6 Surf; boosting either twice or three times is the way to go. All these calculations have been made considering that the opposition is at full health, so they may vary depending on the health of the opponent as well as on the situation of the battle itself.
Having said that, using Thunder Wave first is almost always a good idea. Slowbro is tied with Snorlax as the slowest Pokemon in the game, so paralyzing Snorlax is also a good idea to guarantee Slowbro is faster than it or to fish for full paralysis. Against common Slowbro switch-ins, such as Starmie, Gengar, or Electric-types, Thunder Wave will have to be used as they switch in, so that you can get a boost before they are able to attack. However, it's generally advised to switch Slowbro back after paralyzing the switch-in to get the chance to move two consecutive times the next time they switch in. This way, you can maximize your chances of KOing said check before they are able to score a deadly critical hit Thunderbolt. Even if Starmie or Chansey paralyze Slowbro back in order to outspeed again, using Thunder Wave yourself first was the best move, because the chances of beating an unparalyzed Chansey and especially Starmie are slim, as they can just keep using Recover or Soft-Boiled until Slowbro gets fully paralyzed and they get a chance to use Thunderbolt. An unparalyzed Starmie can also attempt to PP stall Slowbro out of Surfs as well.
Rest is perfectly suited for Slowbro. During the setup, Slowbro generally takes some residual damage and gets paralyzed, but Rest can keep Slowbro healthy and free of status. After maximizing its Special, no special attack can get past Slowbro's Rest without a critical hit, and due to Slowbro's great Defense and lack of exploitable physical weaknesses, it's going to be hard to beat Slowbro from the physical side without Explosion. Tauros, for example, needs a critical hit Body Slam and Hyper Beam to 3HKO Slowbro, which is the only way it has to get past Rest; furthermore, if Tauros gets paralyzed, its chances of beating Slowbro become very small. Snorlax, meanwhile, will generally have to resort to Self-Destruct to take Slowbro down. Rhydon has the luxury of being able to 3HKO Slowbro with its powerful STAB Earthquake most of the time, but will have to switch into the predicted Rest and is OHKOed by even a +0 Surf. As said, Explosion makes a good way to eliminate Slowbro, but an Explosion might not even guarantee that a full health Slowbro goes down or gets revenge killed easily due to Slowbro's already mentioned great Defense. Exeggutor's Explosion, for instance, will only hit Slowbro for around 60%. Lowering Slowbro to around 80% or forcing it to Rest first is the safest way to ensure that one Explosion is enough to let a physical attacker, such as Tauros, Golem, Rhydon, or Persian, to revenge kill it safely.
Psychic is a STAB alternative to Surf, and trades 5 extra power for a 30% chance of scoring a Special fall. As far as type effectiveness is concerned, Psychic gains a neutral hit against Lapras and Cloyster and a super effective hit against Gengar and Victreebel, three of which are effective Slowbro checks, but loses the neutral hit against Alakazam as well as the ability to OHKO Golem and Rhydon at +0, needing two Amnesia boosts to OHKO them. Seismic Toss Alakazam, in particular, will have the opportunity to force you to Rest before Slowbro is able to get past it. Psychic's lower PP could also be a problem against users of recovery moves, especially considering that, without Surf, Alakazam will also require more time to take down. It could also be an issue if your opponent keeps using Recover or Soft-Boiled and gets lucky with full paralysis. Having 8 fewer PP could also be significant in an odd Slowbro war.
Reflect is a possible alternative to Thunder Wave, as it doesn't change the general concept of the set, but changes the way it works in some way and some of its counters. The first thing to notice is the loss of Thunder Wave, which will be problematic in several match-ups. Unless you can paralyze Starmie with another Pokemon, it will hard counter Slowbro. Other specially based Pokemon, such as Chansey, Lapras, Gengar, and Electric-types will also become more problematic if you can't paralyze them; they will have a higher chance of scoring a critical hit Thunderbolt, as they will move first and avoid possible full paralysis. Lastly, Victreebel and Venusaur will have nothing to worry about a Slowbro lacking Thunder Wave unless its attacking move is Psychic. Letting Victreebel in for free could get especially problematic if it's packing Wrap.
The reward of using Reflect comes from the physical side. It almost ensures that none of Snorlax, Golem, and Rhydon will have a chance to take Slowbro down due to their low critical hit rate. Tauros will have a lot of difficulties too, needing two critical hit Body Slams to beat Slowbro while it Rests. Reflect is also great for weakening Explosions, which is one of the most common and "safe" ways of getting rid of Slowbro; even Snorlax's Self-Destruct will only manage around 40% damage. Reflect makes double Explosions necessary to lower Slowbro to the point where it can be revenge killed, which, for the opponent, involves sacrificing at least two Pokemon.

Overview: In a time where Mewtwo ravaged the RBY Ubers landscape and players desperately searched for a good check to it, Slowbro came to answer the call. Slowbro's Amnesia set, known as "TobyBro" and first created by Wintermute in the early 2000s, is the best check to non-Thunderbolt Mewtwo in the tier while being a very strong Pokemon in its own right. Amnesia, along with a great typing and excellent bulk, gives Slowbro immense sweeping potential. A boosted Surf is capable of OHKOing or 2HKOing almost everything in the tier, and even resistant foes are 3HKOed. Amnesia also helps Slowbro patch up its Electric weakness, since Special is used for both offense and defense. Slowbro can even use Thunder Wave to fix its miserable Speed, and it can also reapply the foe's Speed drops from paralysis by using Amnesia.
However, Slowbro will take very heavy damage from a critical hit Thunderbolt regardless of boosts, forcing it to use Rest earlier, and many Electric-type Pokemon have very high critical hit rates courtesy of their high Speed. Slowbro's abysmal Speed, while mitigated by Thunder Wave, can give it trouble as it tries to boost against faster threats while also necessitating some amount of paralysis support from teammates. Slowbro is also very one-dimensional and predictable; however, it will always be one of the most dangerous sweepers, no matter how much the opponent might know it is coming.
Comments: Other Options
Slowbro has the option of forgoing Thunder Wave to run any one of the following options. Withdraw is a very strong option to bolster Slowbro's Defense and allow it to take Explosions, removing a prime option for dealing with it. Withdraw also allows Slowbro to reapply paralysis Speed drops more easily. Its massive 61 PP, combined with Rest, allows Slowbro to PP stall almost any Pokemon it needs to, such as opposing Thunder Wave Slowbro. The Defense boost also lets Slowbro counter Snorlax and Mew, which would otherwise be able to hit Slowbro for decent damage. However, Withdraw Slowbro can be very passive, and teams can take advantage of that with faster threats that Slowbro cannot outspeed without Thunder Wave. Reflect is also an option, as an instant +2 in Defense can be crucial in certain situations, such as Snorlax and Tauros needing instant walling as opposed to permitting multiple turns of setup. However, lower PP, an inability to reapply Speed drops, and an inability to boost past +2 make Reflect less desirable.
Slowbro can also run two attacks, Surf and either Ice Beam or Psychic. Ice Beam prevents Exeggutor from checking Slowbro and can freeze Mewtwo, Chansey, and opposing Slowbro. On the other hand, Psychic allows Slowbro to hit Lapras and pressure Mewtwo, Starmie, and Light Screen Chansey with Special drops. However, running two attacks makes Slowbro more reliant on paralysis support from teammates to be able to outspeed and threaten certain Pokemon like Tauros and Mew. Two attacks Slowbro also gets PP stalled by Thunder Wave Slowbro. Toxic is a niche option to win mirrors against Withdraw Slowbro, since using Rest does not reset the bad poison timer. Also, Toxic can allow Slowbro to effectively pressure and even remove Light Screen Chansey, which otherwise walls it.
Checks and Counters
Electric-types: Zapdos, Jolteon, and Electrode all carry Thunderbolt, which can stop Slowbro from setting up easily. All three of these Pokemon also have good critical hit rates, and a critical hit Thunderbolt from any of them will OHKO Slowbro outright. However, none of them can switch into a boosted attack, and all three are devastated by paralysis.
Electric-type coverage: Non-Electric types like Starmie, Gengar, and Mewtwo can all run Thunderbolt to pressure Slowbro. All three have good critical hit rates, and a critical Thunderbolt can ruin Slowbro. Chansey can also run Thunderbolt, but it is less common; it also has a mediocre critical hit rate, meaning it struggles to pressure Slowbro after it has set up.
Water-resistant Pokemon: Exeggutor and Lapras avoid the 2HKO from +6 Surf and can put Slowbro to sleep with Sleep Powder and Sing, respectively. Lapras also carries Thunderbolt and can deal heavy damage with a critical hit. However, +6 Ice Beam OHKOes Exeggutor, while +2 Ice Beam 2HKOes it, and +4 Psychic 2HKOes Lapras, meaning you must scout for these moves before using these Pokemon to check Slowbro. In a similar vein, Victreebel and Cloyster avoid the OHKO from +6 Surf and can remove Slowbro with Wrap + Razor Leaf or Clamp + Explosion, respectively. However, a single miss of their partial trapping moves can spell doom for either.
Light Screen Chansey: Slowbro cannot 3HKO Chansey after Light Screen with +6 Surf, and it will eventually PP stall Slowbro. However, Slowbro can win the interaction if it gets lucky with a few paralysis turns. Slowbro carrying Toxic also does not fear Light Screen Chansey.
Slowbro: Depending on the set, Slowbro can be checked by its other sets. Thunder Wave beats two attacks sets, Withdraw beats any set besides Toxic, and Toxic always beats every other set.
Moveset: TobyBro (Amnesia)
Description: Set Description
Surf is very strong after a few Amnesia boosts, achieving things like a high chance to 2HKO Chansey at +6 and 2HKOs on Mew, Mewtwo, and Snorlax at +4. Amnesia is what makes this set threatening, letting Slowbro become very bulky and very powerful. Thunder Wave allows Slowbro to patch up its awful Speed and more effectively threaten faster Pokemon. This is amplified by the threat of Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops. Slowbro can also use paralysis to have a chance at beating its checks, like Light Screen Chansey and Starmie. Rest allows Slowbro to stick around for much longer and ensures that a single critical hit cannot end its sweep. It also protects Slowbro from chip damage, which is likely to accumulate while switching in and boosting with Amnesia. However, a sleeping Slowbro is very easy to take advantage of, and many opponents will use it as a chance to switch in their Explosion user or Thunderbolt Mewtwo.
When using Slowbro, it is very important to scout your opponent's team for Electric-type coverage, especially Thunderbolt on Chansey or Mewtwo. However, Chansey very rarely uses Thunderbolt in Ubers, meaning it is usually safe to set up against. Slowbro is very good at setting up against and paralyzing Mewtwo, as it takes very little damage from Mewtwo's attacks even after it has boosted, unless Mewtwo reveals Thunderbolt or gets a critical hit. Either can force Slowbro to repeatedly use Rest and allow Mewtwo to win the interaction with some luck. Slowbro itself is a very good paralysis absorber, since its pitiful Speed means it is not affected much by it. Amnesia reapplying paralysis Speed drops means even a paralyzed Slowbro can outspeed most foes after a few uses of the move. The most common way to remove Slowbro is with Explosion, so users such as Snorlax, Golem, Mew, Exeggutor, and Gengar should be watched carefully. Slowbro should be used with a good absorber of the move, such as Jynx, Rhydon, or your own Golem or Gengar. Absorbing Explosion with these Pokemon requires good prediction on when the foe is about to use the move to switch them in at the right time. Predicting wrong can result in Slowbro getting KOed or the opponent gaining momentum. Alternatively, you can choose to not reveal your Slowbro until later in the game, after the rest of your team has already dealt with opposing Explosion users.
Slowbro especially appreciates Rhydon and Golem as Explosion absorbers, since they are immune to the Electric-type moves that give Slowbro so much trouble. However, Rhydon and Slowbro are both very slow, so using them together requires extra care. If your chosen strategy is to deal with Explosion users before revealing Slowbro, other Pokemon that attract the move such as Chansey, Mew, and Mewtwo can be used. Slowbro can struggle to beat certain checks such as Exeggutor and Lapras, so Pokemon that can deal with them, such as BoltBeam Chansey, are appreciated.

Overview: Slowpoke can differentiate itself from Poliwhirl as an Amnesia sweeper with Thunder Wave to spread paralysis and higher Defense—although its horrid Speed tier makes paralysis especially a necessity and not a luxury. Its Speed tier also makes it a solid Thunder Wave absorber, since it does not mind a Speed drop. It can find setup opportunities on Pokemon it can threaten out with paralysis, or resist the attacks of, which includes Arcanine and Poliwhirl. After an Amnesia, it can deal good damage against Fire-types such as Moltres and Charizard and wall special attackers like Mr. Mime and Porygon. Slowpoke is also a check to opposing Water-types, most importantly Poliwhirl, as, after Sleep Clause has activated, there is little it can do to Slowpoke.
However, Slowpoke’s bulk is quite mediocre, with its physical bulk being average and its special bulk being poor without any boosts. Even at +6 Special, Slowpoke gets ruined by a critical hit Thunderbolt from the likes of Electrode and Mr. Mime. Because of this, it can be taken advantage of while using Rest, which also makes it lose to physical attackers and setup sweepers like Nidoking, Clefable, Charizard, and Kabutops. Slowpoke also faces issues with its abysmal Speed tier; it is very easy to revenge kill and fails as a lead, unable to beat sleep inducers like Venomoth and Poliwhirl, vulnerable to partial trapping users like Dragonair and Pinsir, and targeted by Explosion users like Golem.
Comments: 
Moveset: Amnesia
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Surf is Slowpoke’s best STAB option, offering great offensive coverage that lets it hit the likes of Charizard, Mr. Mime, and Nidoking effectively. Rest allows Slowpoke to continue its sweep by recovering hits taken while setting up, especially thanks to its increased special bulk due to Amnesia. Thunder Wave allows Slowpoke to outspeed and cripple Pokemon that can threaten it.
Slowpoke has a very solid movepool, leaving a good amount of options to choose from. Psychic can be used over Surf, as, even though it is weaker against neutral targets, it sports a 30% special drop rate. It also hits Venomoth super effectively, as well as gaining a neutral hit on Water-types such as Blastoise and Kabutops. Blizzard allows Slowpoke to hit Exeggcute super effectively, as well as still hitting Moltres and Charizard. It also allows Slowpoke to fish for a freeze, which can be useful in a pinch. Ice Beam, although weaker than Blizzard, is more reliable. Fire Blast can deal good damage to Grass- and Bug-types, having a 28.2% chance of OHKOing the likes of Pinsir after an Amnesia. Toxic over Thunder Wave or Rest helps Slowpoke against partial trapping users such as Dragonair and Pinsir. Earthquake over either of those moves allows Slowpoke to deal good damage to Electrode. However, it serves little purpose outside this.
Slowpoke is vulnerable to most Electric-type coverage within the tier, so having an Electric-immune teammate helps greatly. Nidoking and Golem are prime examples of this. Nidoking can switch into Electric-type moves from threats such as Electrode while taking out Pokemon that can force out Slowpoke like Clefable. Golem can switch into moves such as Mr. Mime's Thunderbolt and, after minor damage, KO with Explosion and let Slowpoke in for a sweep. Mr. Mime deserves a special mention, as it is all-around useful and can break through Water-type Pokemon such as Blastoise and Kabutops. Poliwhirl can be used alongside Slowpoke, as Slowpoke spreading paralysis opens Poliwhirl up to sweep late-game. Partial trappers such as Pinsir and Moltres provide a great form of chip damage to facilitate a late-game sweep with Slowpoke. Sleep support from Venomoth or Clefable gives Slowpoke reliable turns to set up against its foes.

Format: PU
Overview: While its stats are mediocre, Slowpoke is blessed with excellent tools that help mitigate this issue and make it a potent offensive threat in PU. Its initially terrible Special can be boosted with Amnesia, turning it into a devastating wallbreaker that can be very hard to KO. While Slowpoke's Speed is the worst in the game, Slowpoke can actually outspeed many foes due to its access to Thunder Wave and a boosting move. Slowpoke's excellent Water / Psychic typing grants neutral coverage against every foe except itself and lets it hit common threats like Nidoqueen and Rapidash for super effective damage. However, Slowpoke's awful base Special and Speed force it to spend multiple turns setting up, providing time for foes to break through or wear it down. This makes Slowpoke an all-or-nothing Pokemon: it often gets only one opportunity per game to set up, and it will rarely sweep due to how much damage it takes in the process. However, when played correctly, Slowpoke can smash through or cripple key pieces of the opposing team, paving the way for a teammate to clean late-game.
Comments: Other Options
Rest or Reflect can be used over either of Slowpoke's attacking moves. The former increases Slowpoke's longevity, making it easier for it to potentially sweep teams. However, Slowpoke's average physical bulk still leaves it 3HKOed by common foes like Fearow and Nidoqueen. The latter makes it much harder for physical attackers to break through it, but damage can still accumulate quickly over time, and many common physical attackers can bypass this boost through critical hits, such as Fearow and Pinsir. Additionally, only having one attacking move can leave Slowpoke walled by either Psychic-types, like Abra and Drowzee, or Water-types, like Staryu and Seaking. Ice-type moves may initially seem useable, since they target Grass-types and Dragonair, foes Slowpoke has huge trouble with. However, Psychic already hits every viable Grass-type for super effective damage, and if it can land an attack, Thunder Wave is more than enough to ruin Dragonair. Additionally, relying on Ice / Water coverage results in Slowpoke being walled by Water-types, while Ice / Psychic coverage is strictly worse against Psychic- and Fire-types than Slowpoke's STAB combination.
Checks and Counters
Sleep Inducers: Every unparalyzed sleep user can outspeed Slowpoke and put it to sleep. Notably, Drowzee and Vileplume don't mind paralysis or Slowpoke's unboosted attacks that much, and thus are likely to eventually land sleep. However, other sleepers such as Gastly dislike Slowpoke's attacks and Thunder Wave, letting Slowpoke get past them if it gets lucky.
Thunderbolt Users: Nidoqueen, Gastly, Staryu, and Dragonair can 2HKO Slowpoke with Thunderbolt. However, these foes must be wary of taking Slowpoke's boosted attacks, and all but Nidoqueen hate Thunder Wave.
Physical Wallbreakers: Fearow and Pinsir can easily overwhelm Slowpoke while it's setting up. However, they are liable to take paralysis and significant damage while doing so, and thus they prefer only coming in against Slowpoke to revenge kill it.
Weepinbell: Weepinbell outspeeds Slowpoke, and its Razor Leaf has a 53.8% chance to OHKO with a critical hit. Weepinbell can also easily put Slowpoke into guaranteed KO range using Wrap, and it isn't OHKOed by a +2 Psychic.
Partial Trapping: Every unparalyzed Pokemon with a partial trapping move can outspeed, pivot around, and wear Slowpoke down into KO range. However, many of these, such as Pinsir and Rapidash, rely on very inaccurate partial trapping moves, and thus they need unreasonable amounts of luck to get Slowpoke into KO range from full. Wrap users and Dragonair in particular threaten Slowpoke the most due to Wrap having the highest accuracy out of any partial trapping move.
Moveset: Amnesia
Description: Set Description
Thunder Wave lets Slowpoke spread paralysis, making its terrible Speed matter less while also aiding its teammates. Amnesia boosts Slowpoke's Special, letting it both hit very hard and take special attacks much better. It also reapplies the Speed drop from paralysis, letting Slowpoke outspeed foes even when it's paralyzed. Psychic and Surf are Slowpoke's two main STAB attacks. The former is more spammable due to its chance to lower the target's Special, while the latter hits opposing Psychic-types for neutral damage and hits Fire- and Ground-types like Rapidash and Graveler super effectively.
Slowpoke is best paired with speedy and powerful wallbreakers like Fearow and Pinsir, as it can cripple or KO crucial parts of the opposing team, making it easier for them to sweep. Slowpoke can easily set up on Omanyte, making it an excellent partner to Rapidash and Arcanine. Slowpoke enjoys fellow paralysis spreaders like Abra and Staryu, as they let it skip having to paralyze its foe while setting up, and combined they force more paralysis on the opposing team. Slowpoke can be used as a lead, beating or crippling offensive Fire-type leads, like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar. However, Slowpoke loses quite badly to sleep leads, and it's vulnerable to Dragonair's Wrap. Alternatively, it can be used in the back and enter after a threat like Rapidash or Staryu lacking Thunderbolt gets a KO, forcing the opponent into a difficult situation where they must either sacrifice an important Pokemon or give Slowpoke a free turn.

Format: PU
Overview: Staryu's phenomenal movepool—complete with fantastic coverage, Recover, and most importantly, Thunder Wave—and good Speed make it a dangerous offensive threat and elite paralysis spreader. Its Water-type STAB moves and Speed dissuade Ground-types like Nidoqueen from switching into it, making its Thunder Wave extremely hard to deny. Staryu isn't just limited to spreading paralysis either—STAB Surf and great coverage let it hit most of the tier for neutral damage, and it can hit notable foes like Arcanine, Rapidash, Fearow, and the aforementioned Nidoqueen super effectively. Despite its extreme frailty, Staryu's access to Recover makes it PU's best answer to Seaking, as its typing and Recover wall it completely bar critical hits as long as it's unparalyzed.
However, it is essential that players don't overestimate Staryu's defensive capabilities—barring Seaking, just about every common foe can reliably paralyze or 2HKO Staryu, if not both, making it very difficult for it to use Recover outside of when it faces Seaking. Once paralyzed, Staryu loses one-on-one to most foes, especially if it's weakened beforehand. Even Seaking can break through Staryu, as Double-Edge into Hyper Beam has a 54.3% chance to KO. Magneton also threatens Staryu immensely, as it OHKOes Staryu and is only 4HKOed in return by Surf. Staryu's offensive presence isn't perfect either, as while only a handful of Pokemon outspeed it, these include common foes like Fearow, which can KO Staryu after the slightest chip damage, and Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar, which can paralyze Staryu with Body Slam and KO it with Hyper Beam. Slower paralysis spreaders also give Staryu considerable trouble, as while they dislike paralysis, Dragonair can wall Staryu depending on its chosen coverage, Porygon can trade Thunder Wave with Staryu, as it is only 3HKOed by Surf 16.4% of the time and threatens Staryu in return with its coverage, and Drowzee can easily switch into Staryu and threaten it and its team with STAB Psychic and dual status. Staryu also has difficulty fitting all of the moves it wants. Alongside the obligatory STAB Surf and Thunder Wave, it has to choose between Thunderbolt and Psychic as well as Recover and Blizzard, leaving it unable to wall Seaking or threaten foes like Grass-types and Dragonair depending on its choice of coverage.

Hydro Pump can be used to hit higher damage ranges, notably 3HKOing Drowzee and Gastly, as well as having a chance to 3HKO Magneton, though it fails to KO most other foes faster than Surf and is much less reliable due to its shaky accuracy.
Checks and Counters
Paralysis: Given that Staryu is 2HKOed by much of the tier, once paralyzed, it's easy to take out. Even foes that can't 2HKO Staryu, like Seaking, can overwhelm it after one turn of full paralysis. Body Slam users like Rapidash and Arcanine can fish for paralysis while dealing solid damage, while Thunder Wave users like Porygon, Abra, and opposing Staryu can use Thunder Wave. However, these foes tend to hate taking paralysis themselves and usually dislike Staryu's STAB and coverage options. Dragonair also has access to Thunder Wave and is more than happy to exchange paralysis with Staryu, as it resists Surf + Thunderbolt and can use Agility. Slowpoke can switch into and threaten paralysis on Staryu lacking Thunderbolt, although it is rare and incredibly weak otherwise. Drowzee deserves a special mention, as it minds neither paralysis nor Staryu's attacks that much, only being 4HKOed by Surf, while it threatens Staryu and its team with not only Thunder Wave but also Hypnosis and a strong STAB Psychic.
Faster Pokemon: Fearow's Double-Edge 2HKOes Staryu, and its Hyper Beam does a minimum of 81.7%. While Fearow dislikes Thunder Wave, it can negate the Speed drop by using Agility, and it's only reliably 2HKOed by Staryu's Blizzard. Although it cannot set up Swords Dance on Staryu, a +2 Scyther OHKOes it with Hyper Beam. Alongside threatening paralysis with Body Slam, Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar outspeed Staryu and can KO it from around 60% using Hyper Beam. Abra outspeeds Staryu and threatens paralysis with Thunder Wave and a 2HKO with Psychic, though it generally despises taking paralysis.
Magneton: Magneton OHKOes Staryu with Thunderbolt and is only 4HKOed in return by Surf. Magneton is also incredibly hard to switch into barring Ground-types, as it threatens paralysis and a strong STAB Thunderbolt on Staryu's teammates.
Gastly: Gastly 2HKOes Staryu with Thunderbolt and is only 3HKOed 75.3% of the time by Surf. It also threatens to sleep Staryu and its teammates with Hypnosis.
Grass-types: Grass-types like Vileplume and the uncommon Weepinbell resist Surf and Thunderbolt and threaten Staryu with Sleep Powder and Stun Spore. Vileplume's enormous bulk leaves it only 3HKOed by Blizzard and generally 4HKOed by Psychic, while Weepinbell outright OHKOes Staryu with Razor Leaf.
Pinsir: While Pinsir dislikes taking paralysis, it 2HKOes Staryu with Slash and is only 3HKOed by Surf, meaning it comfortably beats it one-on-one.
Machamp: Staryu can only 4HKO Machamp without Psychic, and Psychic still only 3HKOes it. In return, Machamp 2HKOes with Submission and has a 69.6% chance to 2HKO with Earthquake, and its combination of Body Slam into Submission has high odds to KO Staryu while also threatening paralysis; Machamp dislikes paralysis, though it can still function regardless.
Moveset: Special Attacker
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Thunder Wave is critical to Staryu's success, letting it spread paralysis to cripple foes like Rapidash, Porygon, and opposing Staryu. It pairs excellently with STAB Surf discouraging Ground-types from switching in; Surf 2HKOes Nidoqueen and OHKOes Graveler, and since Staryu outspeeds them, it wins one-on-one even if they switch into Thunder Wave. Surf also 2HKOes Fire-types like Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar. Thunderbolt is Staryu's primary means of targeting opposing Water-types, notably 2HKOing opposing Staryu and 3HKOing Omanyte and Seaking, limiting the former's opportunities to paralyze Staryu and the latter pair's chances to fish for a critical hit; Thunderbolt also hits Fearow harder than most of Staryu's options, with a 25.6% chance to 2HKO. Psychic is an alternative, notably 3HKOing Gastly and Machamp. Its chance to drop the target's Special makes it threatening against most foes, acting as a strong midground option against Vileplume, as well as opposing Water-types and the rare Weepinbell. Recover lets Staryu effectively check Seaking, as it is a very safe option to use against it. However, it is risky to spam, as many threats like Rapidash and Arcanine can use it to fish for paralysis against Staryu, and using it predictably can allow free entry to foes like Fearow. Blizzard is a potential alternative if Staryu is paired with other Pokemon that can handle Seaking, such as Gastly and one's own Seaking, as it 2HKOes Fearow and Dragonair and 3HKOes Vileplume. It can also let Staryu fish for a freeze, though Staryu is generally better off paralyzing its targets.
Staryu is PU's premier answer to Seaking; Seaking's Double-Edge fails to 2HKO and slowly wears Seaking down, and Hyper Beam only deals slightly over 50% and gives Staryu a free turn. If Seaking doesn't use Agility, Staryu outspeeds it, so it can spam Recover as Double-Edge's recoil brings Seaking into KO range. If Seaking uses Agility as Staryu uses Recover or switches in, Staryu can then paralyze it with Thunder Wave, forcing Seaking to use another Agility and giving Staryu potential free turns due to full paralysis. If Seaking is confirmed to not have Double-Edge, it is safe for Staryu to attack it instead of spamming Recover. A healthy Staryu only has to be afraid of Seaking getting a critical hit with Hyper Beam, which OHKOes it.
Staryu's excellent matchup against Seaking makes it a good partner to teammates weak to Seaking, like Rapidash, Nidoqueen, and Arcanine. However, it cannot do this when it's paralyzed, and thus it enjoys teammates that can switch into Thunder Wave users, such as Drowzee, Magneton, and Nidoqueen. Ground-types such as Nidoqueen and Graveler make great partners for Staryu, as they wall Magneton, which otherwise gives Staryu great trouble, while also appreciating the paralysis Staryu spreads. Staryu also appreciates being partnered with strong physical wallbreakers like Fearow and Pinsir, which are especially adept at removing Drowzee, which otherwise switches into and threatens Staryu with Hypnosis and STAB Psychic with relatively little risk. While Staryu hates paralysis, in some instances it is necessary to be paralyzed, such as trading Thunder Wave with Porygon to enable Nidoqueen or exchanging paralysis with opposing Staryu to enable Seaking. Once paralyzed, Staryu loses virtually all of its defensive utility and is easily overwhelmed, but if it's at full health, it can still be threatening, as it's difficult to OHKO; it also stonewalls Omanyte, since the only thing it threatens Staryu with is paralysis. Staryu is dominated by Fearow, Rapidash, and Arcanine, as they outspeed and can KO a weakened Staryu, so Rock-types like Graveler for the first and Omanyte for all three work well as partners. Staryu also appreciates Rock-type teammates because it has poor matchups against Arcanine, Rapidash, and Magmar, which it can't switch into well and typicallloses one-on-one to.
Staryu can be used at multiple points throughout a game, and its role changes depending on when it is used. It can be used early- and mid-game to revenge kill slower foes such as Nidoqueen; however, this puts it in a position to be revenge killed itself by faster foes such as Fearow and Arcanine, especially if it gets chipped. This means it cannot effectively check Seaking later on in the game. Staryu can be saved throughout the game and avoid getting chipped to effectively check Seaking, although this may exacerbate a team's weaknesses to Fearow and Magneton later on if Staryu's team lacks a healthy check to them.

Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Tangela is generally considered good in the current metagame
<hr>
Overview
Upon first glance, it may be difficult to ascertain why any player would even consider using Tangela in a competitive match. It has very little offensive presence, a limited movepool, and a Speed lower than even Vaporeon. It is also quite vulnerable to Wrap users and Ice-type moves, both of which are rather common in the tier. It makes sense that Tangela was first perceived as little more than a gimmick.
While Tangela is still far from a staple, it has begun to establish itself in the tier because it compresses a precise combination of desirable traits. For starters, the pure Grass typing makes Tangela a strong check to Earthquake users like Dugtrio and Golem without picking up a weakness to Rock Slide. It similarly prepares Tangela to check Electric-types like Electabuzz and Raichu. Sleep Powder is a blessing in a tier where the few other sleep inducers largely rely on the rather inaccurate Hypnosis, making Tangela more reliable and freeing up Hypnosis users to explore alternative sets and play more aggressively. Additionally, Tangela's access to Stun Spore lets it stymie opposing sweepers and Wrap users, such as Dugtrio and Tentacruel, while also enabling friendly sweepers and Wrap users. Stun Spore is also notable for being the only move that can paralyze Dugtrio behind a Substitute. Finally, while it is not on the level of defensive staples like Vaporeon and Omastar, Tangela can be a makeshift check to a lot of common sweepers when at full health. Normal-type Pokemon like Kangaskhan and Persian usually win the matchup but tend to fear paralysis. Tangela does not fit on every team by any means, but its unique combination of defensive and supportive traits can make it the perfect choice on a select few, rather potent teams.
Even with all of these positives, Tangela still has many flaws and can be easily exploited by many Pokemon. Tangela's extremely low Speed makes it easy to chip down with Wrap and revenge kill. Its Grass typing also leaves it vulnerable to Ice-type moves from the likes of Articuno and the tier’s many Water-type Pokemon, as well as Dodrio’s Drill Peck. Poor offensive options also leave it nearly unable to touch some Pokemon, including Dragonite, Haunter, and other Grass-type Pokemon. Finally, Sleep Powder's and Stun Spore's imperfect accuracy can occasionally mean the difference between a win and a loss. Thus, Tangela should only be used when its unique role compression cannot be replicated by other team members.
Comments: Other Options
By far the most enticing option in Tangela’s toolkit is a Swords Dance set with Body Slam, Hyper Beam, or both. However, boosting is really difficult in RBY UU, especially when neither Speed nor a defensive stat is rising. Moreover, Tangela’s Attack stat and physical movepool are dismal, making such a set underwhelming even in ideal conditions.
When experimenting with different sets for Tangela, generally refrain from removing Tangela's status moves, especially Sleep Powder. This keeps it from being outclassed by other defensive Pokemon.
Checks and Counters
Haunter: Once Tangela uses Stun Spore against Haunter, it is virtually incapable of further threatening it. Haunter resists or is immune to every single move Tangela can learn. Even if Tangela somehow maximizes its Special with Growth, Mega Drain can only sometimes score a 4HKO. Haunter, on the other hand, scores an easy 4HKO with Night Shade or a 5HKO or better with Psychic.
Flying-type Pokemon: All of the tier’s prominent Flying-type Pokemon threaten Tangela. Much like Haunter, Dragonite is simply not afraid of any move that Tangela can throw at it. Dragonite can use its superior Speed to work Tangela’s health down with Wrap and easily put it away with Blizzard or any powerful physical attack, possibly even leaving the entire exchange unscathed. Articuno similarly fears none any of Tangela’s attacks, and its incredibly strong Blizzard boasts an impressive 51.3% chance to simply OHKO Tangela. The rare Moltres functions nearly identically and takes even less from Mega Drain. Dodrio does fear paralysis and doesn't have Wrap to avoid getting hit like Dragonite, but it can easily revenge kill Tangela, as Drill Peck is a clean 2HKO. Gyarados has the least desirable matchup of the Flying-type Pokemon but can still 2HKO with Blizzard provided Tangela doesn’t reclaim too much health with Mega Drain.
Grass-, Bug-, and Fire-type Pokemon: While these Pokemon are a fair deal less common than the Pokemon discussed above, they still check Tangela thoroughly. While it admittedly can’t do much in return, Venusaur shrugs off virtually any hit Tangela can throw at it. Venomoth likewise takes very little damage from Tangela and can threaten paralysis or possibly 5HKO with Psychic. Yet again, Pinsir is unafraid of Tangela’s moves and can pivot out with Bind, set up with Swords Dance, or 3HKO it outright with Slash. Fire-types, while exceedingly uncommon, will check Tangela and claim 2HKOs or OHKOs with Fire Blast.
Ice-type Moves: Outside of Articuno and Dragonite, Tangela can beat most users of Ice-type moves with status or Mega Drain. However, every major user of Blizzard or Ice Beam aside from Omastar is faster than Tangela and thus can pressure it, especially if it has taken a few hits or hasn't used Growth yet. So long as these Pokemon aren't paralyzed, they are capable of revenge killing Tangela or even winning one-on-one.
Tentacruel: While Tentacruel would prefer not to risk getting paralyzed, it is more than capable of handling Tangela. Like Dragonite, Tentacruel can easily whittle Tangela down with Wrap and finish it off with a powerful Blizzard.
Moveset: Defensive Pivot
Description: Set Description
This set allows Tangela to function as a pivot. Sleep Powder and Stun Spore are more or less essential to any variant of Tangela. These two moves give it a significant amount of utility, allowing it to punish switch ins and enable its teammates to sweep. Even with Bind, Tangela is largely outclassed by other prominent Dugtrio checks like Dragonite and Gyarados if it chooses not to run both status moves. Bind functions just like Wrap, albeit with slightly lower accuracy, dealing chip damage and generating safe switches. Due to Tangela's low speed, Bind is most useful against paralyzed targets, though Tangela can usually afford to take a hit before using Bind if it must. Body Slam is very weak from Tangela, but it hits most targets neutrally and threatens paralysis. Mega Drain is similarly weak, but can hit a few targets for super effective damage and get Tangela a little health back in the process. Omastar and Golem are particularly fearful of Mega Drain, which is likely to 2HKO both. Rest serves to make Tangela a more complete wall but makes it even less offensively threatening. Due to Tangela having essentially no offensive presence with Rest, it may be worth running Body Slam or Mega Drain over Bind.

Moveset: Defensive Growth
Description: Set Description
This set is a slightly more offensive take on the traditionally defensive Pokemon. Growth slowly boosts both Tangela's offensive and defensive prowess. While some Pokemon like Dragonite and Haunter are still not fazed by Tangela’s offenses, this set can bully some defensive Pokemon. Examples include Hypno and Vaporeon, especially if they have been paralyzed; unless they can land a critical hit, Tangela is relatively free to boost with Growth while both dealing damage and regaining health with Mega Drain. The threat of Stun Spore crippling a teammate pressures these Pokemon from switching out. Sleep Powder is always a useful move and allows Tangela to accomplish something even when it can’t quite get going with Growth. Moreover, after successfully using Sleep Powder, Tangela can use Stun Spore to potentially punish a switch-in looking to keep Tangela from setting up with Growth.

Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Vaporeon is generally considered good in the current metagame
<hr>
Overview
Vaporeon stands out as the best among the many bulky Water-types in RBY UU, providing teams with a backbone against offensive behemoths like Tentacruel and Articuno. It often takes multiple Pokemon to KO Vaporeon, and because of its monstrous Special stat, they will also have to take very strong STAB Surfs in the process. Even many super effective attacks, such as Electabuzz's Thunderbolt, will fail to 2HKO it. Vaporeon is capable of dueling and checking mighty physical attackers like Kangaskhan and Dugtrio as well. Vaporeon isn't too concerned about paralysis either, making it one of the best absorbers of the status in the tier. Checking Normal-types, Articuno, Dugtrio, and even Tentacruel all in one, Vaporeon blends offense and defense perfectly, making it a very appreciated addition to many successful RBY UU teams.
Still, though, Vaporeon is very slow, which can leave it vulnerable to Wrap from Dragonite or Tentacruel. Worse still, if Vaporeon is low on HP, this Wrap use will deny it from healing off damage with Rest. Vaporeon's reliance on Rest will also let heavy-hitting Pokemon like Persian, Kangaskhan, and Dugtrio safely switch in on the turn Rest is used, putting Vaporeon in a very precarious position. Being outrun by every sleeper in the tier, bar Tangela, can also make Vaporeon easy to put to sleep again after Rest if Sleep Clause isn't active. Finally, Vaporeon lacks coverage for opposing Water-types, though its higher damage output does tend to let it win prolonged interactions.
Comments: Other Options
Hydro Pump is an immensely strong option that allows Vaporeon to 2HKO almost any Pokemon that doesn't resist it, with some standout calculations being 2HKOs on Electabuzz, Persian, and Kangaskhan. However, its accuracy and PP leave much to be desired, making what should be the team's anchor very inconsistent. This also makes it easier for opposing Rest users to PP stall Vaporeon. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon wall physical attackers like Dodrio and Kangaskhan as well as take much less chip damage from Wrap, which can define late-game scenarios when its checks are removed. However, since it doesn't help against Persian or special attackers, which are just as common, it's difficult to justify.
Checks and Counters
Gyarados: Gyarados resists Surf and takes 27.7% maximum from Blizzard, all while possessing coverage in Thunderbolt to 4HKO Vaporeon, which can be turned into a 3HKO with Hyper Beam. Vaporeon simply can't risk contending with a healthy Gyarados and will be forced out by it frequently. Furthermore, the best counterplay to Vaporeon is to switch in on a predicted Rest to give it what for, and Gyarados is among the best punishes to a resting Vaporeon in the tier thanks to its offensive prowess.
Venusaur: Venusaur outspeeds Vaporeon and threatens it with either an uncontested Sleep Powder or a 2HKO from Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a particularly heavy punish to a resting Vaporeon as a result. The punish especially hurts if it's running Swords Dance, allowing it to set up and still get the 2HKO before Vaporeon can act. However, Venusaur really doesn't want to switch into Blizzard, which deals up to 60%, adding a degree of risk to the prediction game.
Haunter: Haunter is capable of switching in on Vaporeon's Body Slam and can 3HKO with Thunderbolt about half the time. Additionally, if necessary, Explosion KOes Vaporeon from half HP. Since it's faster, Haunter can also threaten Vaporeon with Hypnosis.
Normal-type Attackers: Strong physical attackers, like the tier's resident Normal-types, are great at switching in on and punishing Vaporeon's Rest. Persian is the most reliable method of dispatching Vaporeon, 3HKOing it with Slash. While less consistent overall, Dodrio and Kangaskhan can KO Vaporeon after two Body Slams followed by Hyper Beam. However, none of these Pokemon want to contest Vaporeon's nuclear attacks, especially if it runs Hydro Pump, which 2HKOes all of them. Even without Hydro Pump, Surf and Blizzard alike have odds to 2HKO them as well.
Electric-types: Electabuzz, Raichu, and the rare Electrode can switch in on Rest and 3HKO Vaporeon with STAB Thunderbolt. Plus, thanks to their high Speed stats, a critical hit from any of them is reasonably likely and can be difficult for Vaporeon to recover from later. In a tight spot, Electrode also guarantees a 2HKO using Thunderbolt + Explosion. However, they all take significant damage from Surf, which they can't afford in the long run. In fact, if they switch in on Surf, they're liable to lose the one-on-one, making them deceptively shaky checks.
Swords Dance Tentacruel: If using a Swords Dance set, Tentacruel can swiftly chip Vaporeon down through Wrap damage and KO it from half HP with a +2 Hyper Beam. However, Tentacruel can't afford to switch into Body Slam, lest it gets forced into Rest much earlier than usual, and the Swords Dance set rarely runs Rest anyway. If Tentacruel doesn't have Swords Dance, however, Vaporeon can absolutely fish for a Wrap miss to either try for Body Slam paralysis or use Rest to PP stall. Ergo, standard Tentacruel sets should not be considered reliable Vaporeon checks.
Dewgong: If using Ice Beam, Dewgong can engage in a freeze war with Vaporeon which, given it exhausts all its PP, has an 81.98% chance of succeeding. Since its Ice typing makes it immune to being frozen itself, and its Water typing lets it resist Vaporeon's STAB moves, Dewgong is a serviceable answer to Vaporeon. However, Dewgong is less bulky than Vaporeon, making it more difficult to wake up from Rest in the long run. This also causes it to fail to outdamage Vaporeon in prolonged interactions.
Moveset: Bulky Special Attacker
Description: Set Description
The combination of Surf and Blizzard is resisted only by Water-types and allows Vaporeon to deal significant damage to teams thanks to its incredible Special. STAB Surf is very powerful, 3HKOing Pokemon like Kangaskhan, Kadabra, and Persian. Crucially, it also lets Vaporeon consistently OHKO Dugtrio, making it a very important check. Blizzard 2HKOes Venusaur and Dodrio, as well as possibly OHKOing Dragonite. Body Slam enables Vaporeon to hit Water-types and thus the entire tier for neutral damage and scout for switch-ins, critically Tentacruel, which can flip the situation on its head if they get paralyzed. Tentacruel becomes much more manageable if it gets paralyzed, because it has to use Rest much earlier, so Body Slam denies it free entry. Rest gives Vaporeon significant longevity while removing the paralysis it will likely absorb early-game. Vaporeon's combined great offensive pressure and bulk warps the opponent's offensive play as well; this should be exploited to force out their key offensive Pokemon while getting free turns to scout with Body Slam.
Vaporeon fits on a variety of teams. Pairing Vaporeon with almost any Flying-type Pokemon, like Dodrio or Aerodactyl, is a good choice thanks to its Ice resistance allowing it to check Articuno for them. Dragonite works particularly well, providing Vaporeon with an Electric neutrality and Grass resistance to fall back on. The two also offer each other essential paralysis support, as Vaporeon can use Body Slam against targets such as Tentacruel and Kadabra, while Dragonite can use Thunder Wave against offensive Normal-type Pokemon. Moreover, Vaporeon paired with any Flying-type Pokemon is a particularly good way to keep Dugtrio wavering between Earthquake, Rock Slide, and Slash. Oftentimes, Dugtrio is forced to use Slash, which is far easier to play around, at least compared to its nuclear Earthquake. Other Ice-weak Pokemon, such as Venusaur and Dugtrio, also appreciate Vaporeon's presence for similar reasons. Vaporeon makes a particularly potent defensive core alongside the ubiquitous Hypno as well; Vaporeon handles Dugtrio and Normal-types, while Hypno handles Electric-types and Venusaur.
Teams that struggle against Wrap, particularly those with frailer Pokemon like Kadabra, will also benefit greatly from Vaporeon's presence, since it can take a massive amount of chip damage before it's in KO range for anything. Vaporeon can also be used alongside other bulky Water-types, such as Tentacruel, Gyarados, and Omastar, to make teams even more resilient to Wrap and offensive pressure. During Rest, remember that being trapped by Wrap still depletes sleep turns, which makes Vaporeon deceptively easy to wake up and therefore very effective for these types of teams. Vaporeon's HP must be carefully managed when against Wrap users, however.

This, combined with Acid Armor to patch up its lacking base 60 Defense, lets Vaporeon be a great wall not only specially, but also physically; at just +2 Defense, Snorlax's Body Slam becomes a 6HKO. Vaporeon has much higher base Special compared to the other notable Water-type setup sweeper, Slowbro, dealing good damage with Surf even without any Growth boosts. Vaporeon's higher base Special also allows it to tank special hits much easier; Starmie or Chansey only 4HKO with Thunderbolt. This higher base Special also allows Vaporeon to live a critical hit Thunderbolt from Starmie and Chansey with relative ease, taking just 63.4% maximum from a Starmie Thunderbolt critical hit. Vaporeon's large amount of boosting moves also lets it reapply a paralyzed foe's Speed drop up to nine times, while Slowbro can only reapply a paralyzed foe's Speed drop three times.
However, Vaporeon is in stark competition with Slowbro for the role of bulky Water-type, and Slowbro has Amnesia, better physical bulk, and Thunder Wave. Vaporeon also shares Slowbro's issues of having to rely on Rest for recovery and takes a lot more turns than Slowbro to set up, making it quite exploitable. However, once Vaporeon gets the ball rolling, it's hard to stop it, with a +5 Surf mowing over even Water-resistant foes. It also can tank one critical hit Thunderbolt from Starmie, Chansey, or Gengar, which Slowbro can't do due to its worse special bulk. Vaporeon is also noticeably faster than Slowbro, outspeeding the likes of Snorlax, Chansey, Exeggutor, and Rhydon, although it's still not fast enough to outspeed most common foes.

Moveset: Growth
Description: Set Description
Growth raises Vaporeon's Special even higher, allowing it to increase its special bulk and the power of its STAB Surf. Surf 2HKOes Tauros, Persian, and often Jolteon at +1, though bulkier foes, such as Snorlax, Zapdos, and Hypno require two Growth boosts to 2HKO. Acid Armor lets Vaporeon boost up its measly base 60 Defense, taking paltry damage at +2 from even the strongest physical attacks; it's 6HKOed at +2 by Snorlax's Body Slam, and 7HKOed by Tauros's Body Slam, allowing Vaporeon to shrug off the damage and use Rest with ease, although Tauros's high critical hit rate makes using Rest in front of it risky, as Vaporeon takes 52.9% minimum from a critical hit Body Slam. Acid Armor also has 61PP, which, in combination with Growth, gives Vaporeon a staggering 122PP at its disposal without cutting into Surf and Rest PP, letting it PP stall any foe with ease. Rest lets Vaporeon heal off any stray hits it may take while setting up. Acid Armor can be dropped within reason, as it isn't always needed for Vaporeon to be an effective sweeper. Ice Beam hits Grass and Flying-types for super effective damage, and at +1 Vaporeon is heavily favored to 2HKO Zapdos and Exeggutor. Body Slam allows Vaporeon to paralyze non-Normal-types, but it deals very little damage. Hydro Pump hits much harder than Surf, notably 2HKOing Tauros and Persian unboosted and 2HKOing Snorlax, Alakazam, and Gengar at +1. However, it's often unreliable due to its low accuracy and PP. Substitute can be used to protect Vaporeon from stray critical hits and grant safety when using Rest, as a +1 Vaporeon's Substitute is not broken by Starmie or Chansey's Thunderbolt; Gengar's Thunderbolt is also not favored to break it.
Vaporeon should be used on a team with good paralysis support, as it lacks any meaningful way to paralyze Starmie, Alakazam, and Chansey, which might otherwise pose issues to it. Vaporeon can also use Growth and Acid Armor to reapply the speed drop from paralysis, letting it outspeed a paralyzed Starmie or Alakazam even if paralyzed itself. Vaporeon needs physical attacking support to help break through special walls like Chansey and Starmie, so it benefits from partners like a Lovely Kiss or all-out attacking Snorlax, as well as Explosion users such as Exeggutor and Golem, as they can neutralize foes that may cause Vaporeon issues with Explosion or status.

Format: NU
Overview: Venomoth is the fastest and most dangerous sleeper in NU. It can quickly remove one foe from play with Sleep Powder, which also forces the opponent to switch into Stun Spore, generating a massive early advantage. Venomoth single-handedly prevents early-game usage of slower Pokemon, as critical threats like Blastoise and Clefable cannot afford to be put to sleep. Venomoth can function as a lead, but it more often serves to punish opponents for over-utilizing slower Pokemon before Sleep Clause takes effect. Its Speed tier also allows it to trade hits with Nidoking or Mr. Mime after it lands its status moves, and while its Psychic is not particularly strong, it can still dent foes heavily with a critical hit or Special drop.
Venomoth's biggest weakness is its sheer lack of offense—it has no STAB options and relies heavily on Special drops to deal passable damage, so it struggles to break through paralyzed foes—which it cannot put to sleep—and especially flounders against Fire-types. Double-Edge helps to cover Mr. Mime, but it deals just a bit less damage than needed to truly give Venomoth a chance one-on-one.Venomoth's mediocre typing and bulk limit it defensively, as the tier's various Fire-types, Mr. Mime, and Fearow all outspeed or Speed tie it and force it out; Golem's Rock Slide is also a major threat. However, the sheer power of sleep and paralysis ensure a strong niche for Venomoth.
Comments: Other Options
Hyper Beam can be used to finish off Mr. Mime at the cost of either Psychic’s coverage or the ability to combat a healthy Mr. Mime. In particular, Mr. Mime always falls to Hyper Beam after two Seismic Tosses, whereas Double-Edge has a mere 23% chance to KO here. Thus, Hyper Beam is an option for insurance on teams leading Mr. Mime. Hyper Beam also deals more damage than Psychic to most foes, allowing Venomoth to sometimes secure a surprise KO on Clefable, Blastoise, or even Charizard after wearing them down.
Checks and Counters
Fire-types: Venomoth is outsped and 2HKOed by Charizard and Ninetales, both of which also have a high chance to critically hit it. Moltres only Speed ties Venomoth, but its nuclear Fire Blast OHKOes Venomoth, which deals piddling amounts of damage back. All Fire-types are also effective sleep blockers when paralyzed, forcing Venomoth to slowly wear them down before it can land sleep.
Mr. Mime: While Mr. Mime fears sleep, it 2HKOes Venomoth and has a high critical hit chance, giving it multiple paths to victory. Paralyzed Mr. Mime blocks sleep moderately effectively, as Double-Edge is only a 4HKO.
Fearow: Fearow is a rare sight, but it outspeeds and 2HKOes Venomoth, just like the Fire-types. It is significantly easier to wear down with Psychic, but it can potentially set up Agility in front of Venomoth and deal heavy damage as it switches out.
Exeggcute: Once Sleep Clause is in effect, Exeggcute easily stops Venomoth. It takes very little damage from Venomoth's attacks and does not mind paralysis, retaliating with Psychic for a 30% likely 2HKO. Exeggcute can easily fish for sleep or paralysis against Venomoth or switch-ins as well.
Golem: Golem's Rock Slide deals upward of 70% to Venomoth, and Body Slam followed by Rock Slide has a high chance to KO, making it risky for Venomoth to switch in. Mega Drain Venomoth can deal heavy damage to Golem, but it still loses one-on-one unless Golem has been chipped. Golem can also use Explosion to even up a losing matchup.
Moveset: Double Powder
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Venomoth's main use is to land sleep, then fish for paralysis as the opponent inevitably switches out, since keeping a slower Pokemon in to try to wake up achieves nothing. Stun Spore helps to keep out dangerous threats like Charizard, Moltres, and Fearow, usually forcing the foe to switch in Clefable or Mr. Mime after Sleep Powder lands, accepting paralysis. Psychic is Venomoth's best attack against most foes, scoring a 3HKO on Nidoking and opposing Venomoth, and it threatens repeated Special drops against Water-types and other switch-ins. Double-Edge is primarily for Mr. Mime, either to fight it directly after landing paralysis, or to punish an already-paralyzed Mr. Mime switching in to block sleep. Double-Edge deals about as much damage as Psychic against most switch-ins, though, so it can also be used as a midground option. As an alternative to Double-Edge, Mega Drain nearly 2HKOes both Golem and Kabutops, only needing slight chip damage to guarantee it. However, it is useless versus everything else.
Venomoth can act as a lead, matching up well versus any slower lead and having decent odds to put Mr. Mime to sleep, but is forced out by Charizard or Ninetales due to the risk of a critical hit or Sleep Powder miss. In most games, it will instead switch in after a few turns to take advantage of a slower foe like Blastoise. Once in, it lands sleep and follows up with Stun Spore until something is paralyzed; if there is a preexisting paralyzed foe, Venomoth may opt to simply attack in case said foe switches in, returning later to land sleep. After landing sleep and paralysis, Venomoth can either stay in and trade hits until it drops or switch out after paralyzing the foe. Trading hits is advisable if the opponent uses Clefable to absorb Stun Spore, as Venomoth can often weaken it severely with Psychic before going down. Venomoth can also be saved to fight Rock-types with Mega Drain, to sacrifice to sleep later, or to prevent the opponent from ever sacrificing their slept Pokemon—this would let Venomoth land a second sleep. Venomoth pairs well with allies that bait in Water-types, as these are its easiest entry point; for example, leading Charizard or Ninetales often forces Blastoise in, as does using Golem early. Slower allies such as Kingler and Golem particularly appreciate Venomoth's paralysis support, as does Nidoking. Mega Drain Venomoth also works well with allies that normally falter in front of Rock-types, such as Moltres and Ninetales.

Format: OU
Overview: Venusaur used to be used more often in earlier RBY OU metagames, but it fell out of favor due to the amount of Psychic- and Ice-type moves, as well as paralysis, thrown around. Still, it stands out as a Swords Dance wallbreaker that isn't hindered by Rhydon, and it can cleave through bulky Water-types like Starmie, Cloyster, and Slowbro thanks to Razor Leaf: Razor Leaf is one of the most consistent ways to dispatch Slowbro in the tier, and deceptively few teams are actually prepared for it. Venusaur is one of faster viable sleepers in the tier, only being outsped by Jynx and Gengar. It can act as a soft check to Snorlax, which is unlikely to 3HKO Venusaur and may be forced into a Rest loop by Razor Leaf, letting Venusaur set up. Venusaur often can be a two-for-one with sleep as one "KO", and Swords Dance + Hyper Beam picking up the second.
However, a horrible defensive typing makes Venusaur harder to use effectively. It takes super effective damage from the very common Psychic and Blizzard, which will often deal heavy damage or force it out. Because of this, Venusaur adds very little defensive synergy to a team. Secondly, Venusaur's coverage is limited to Grass and Normal, allowing Gengar to hard wall it. Finally, it has competition with Victreebel. Victreebel also has STAB Razor Leaf, gets Wrap and Stun Spore, and has a higher Attack stat. It, however, has lower Defense and Speed than Venusaur. This means that, although Venusaur is less prone to being revenge killed by Tauros and never has to worry about Cloyster speed ties, it lacks the surprise factor and misses out on a few important damage ranges when compared to Victreebel, further narrowing its niche.
Comments: 
Moveset: Swords Dance
Description: Sleep Powder allows Venusaur to keep a Pokemon out of play for up to the entirety of the game. Combined with Venusaur's Speed, you should be able to find an opportunity to land sleep in most games. Razor Leaf is Venusaur's best STAB option, landing a critical hit 99.6% of the time. Razor Leaf's primary target will be Water-types such as Starmie and Slowbro in addition to Rhydon. However, Razor Leaf also notably can 2HKO Tauros after just a little chip damage, while Tauros is unable to 2HKO Venusaur back. Swords Dance allows Venusaur to wallbreak and sweep when paired with Hyper Beam.
Venusaur primarily uses sleep from itself or a teammate to set up Swords Dance. One of the best times to set up is immediately after sleeping a Pokemon, which gives a free turn whether it switches or stays in. Another good time is when an opposing Pokemon such as Snorlax or Slowbro is about to use Rest; you can also use Razor Leaf instead to deal damage to a switch-in or force Snorlax into a Rest loop. Before setting up, you also should deal with key threats that outspeed Venusaur and threaten it with high damage or paralysis—especially Gengar, which hard walls it—and avoid any damage or status unless Venusaur absolutely has to take it. After one Swords Dance, Venusaur has a 74.4% chance to OHKO Alakazam and OHKOes Chansey with a bit of initial damage; after a second Swords Dance, it has an 84.6% to KO Starmie with a single Hyper Beam. At +6 Attack, a majority of Pokemon that do not resist Hyper Beam will be OHKOed. Even if Venusaur fails to sweep an entire team, you likely got sleep off and took out at least one fast Pokemon on the opponent's team, possibly Tauros. This lets Venusaur enable Rhydon due to Tauros being one of the main obstacles for Rhydon. Rhydon also pairs nicely with Venusaur because it handles threats such as Zapdos and Pin Missile Jolteon that threaten Venusaur.
When using Venusaur, you should not put it in the lead spot. Its Speed does not allow it to do well against any of the common leads, and leading off puts Venusaur in the face of danger early, which can weaken its offensive potential. Waiting to deploy Venusaur lets it get sleep off without risking any Speed ties with Exeggutor. If you paralyze the common leads—Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx—before getting sleep, they often cannot switch in comfortably anyway. Starmie will be threatened by Razor Leaf, and Alakazam and Jynx will usually fall to a +2 Hyper Beam. Body Slam may look enticing for its paralysis chance and lack of recharging, but it is not strong enough to make as much use out of Swords Dance as Hyper Beam.

Natures: 
Format: UU
Overview: NOTE: The following analysis was produced prior to the bans on Hypno and Articuno. Venusaur is generally considered unviable in the current metagame.
<hr>
For a while, Venusaur was close to obsolete in UU because Victreebel, which was an already fairly uncommon pick, largely outclassed it. However, Victreebel eventually exited the tier for OU, opening a power vacuum Venusaur was happy to occupy. Thanks to this and a few significant metagame shifts, Venusaur has become a permanent resident of RBY UU.
Despite its humble origins, Venusaur is a powerful threat. Sleep is deadly in RBY and Venusaur boasts the second-fastest reliable sleep move in UU, behind only Venomoth. While Venusaur is much slower than tier staples like Tentacruel and Kadabra, its Speed tier is still a cut above several bulky Pokemon, like Hypno and Vaporeon, and happens to be shared with Dragonite. It is in these matchups where Venusaur most often thrives, as it can either use Sleep Powder uncontested or fire off its surprisingly powerful Razor Leaf. Venusaur is a threat that can bully Pokemon with Sleep Powder early-game and continue to exert some offensive pressure once a foe is asleep.
Like Victreebel before it, Venusaur is notably restricted by its typing; while Poison does grant an immunity to Toxic, it isn't good for much else. It leaves Venusaur quite vulnerable to Psychic from common Pokemon like Hypno, Kadabra, and Electabuzz while making Earthquake deal neutral damage. Combine this with an Ice weakness and you get a Pokemon with numerous troublesome matchups and some difficulty switching in.
Comments: Other Options
Venusaur has a few interesting moves available to it, though most are not especially useful. Hyper Beam is arguably its best alternative, being used over Toxic to hit a few targets for extra damage and finish off foes like Hypno a bit earlier. Rather impressively, it does well over 60% to Kadabra. Just note that dropping Toxic leaves Venusaur much more susceptible to partial-trapping.
A Swords Dance set is possible, but it doesn't exactly take advantage of Venusaur's strengths, and other Pokemon like Tentacruel and Pinsir run the move with more consistency.
Leech Seed is a possible alternative to Toxic to deal with partial-trapping while also giving Venusaur some health back; it gives roughly as much as Wrap takes away. The move does have higher accuracy than Toxic, but the effect isn't permanent, and it deals much less damage. Leech Seed also has the advantage of affecting Tentacruel, though it is unable to hit Tangela. The move can also be used in tandem with Toxic to continuously escalate Leech Seed's drained health, but setting this up in a real match is much easier said than done.
Checks and Counters
Haunter: If Venusaur has already used Sleep Powder on something else, Haunter is a pretty big issue. Venusaur's only option is Razor Leaf, which is 5HKO or worse. Haunter can 3HKO it if it's carrying Psychic or 4HKO with Night Shade.
Flying-type Pokemon: Venusaur's Body Slam isn't particularly strong, so most Flying-type Pokemon can easily scare it away. Dragonite and Articuno take very little damage from any of Venusaur's moves and can 2HKO with Blizzard, though it is only guaranteed for the latter. Dodrio can set up Agility fairly freely in front of Venusaur, as Drill Peck is a 2HKO and Body Slam can't paralyze it. While rare, Moltres performs almost identically to Articuno against Venusaur.
Psychic Users: Kadabra is the scariest foe that can exploit Venusaur's weakness to Psychic, as it outpaces Venusaur and 2HKOes it. Due to the risk of a critical hit, Venusaur will almost always switch out, assuming Kadabra is healthy. Note that Hyper Beam is a legitimate threat to a paralyzed Kadabra, however. Hypno also 2HKOes but is slower, so it only really acts as a check if it is paralyzed or if one of its teammates is already asleep. Electabuzz is very likely to 3HKO Venusaur if it has Psychic, though Razor Leaf is also a 3HKO. Interestingly, the uncommon Venomoth is a premier Venusaur check. It effortlessly shrugs off Razor Leaf, outspeeds, carries Sleep Powder and Stun Spore, and 3HKOes with Psychic.
Ice-type Moves: Fortunately for Venusaur, it is faster than most users of Ice-type moves, so it is much less afraid of them than its rival Tangela. Nonetheless, there are a few Pokemon that can outspeed and threaten Venusaur. Tentacruel is the most prominent, as it can use Wrap and score a KO as early as 63.9%. Gyarados doesn't take Razor Leaf very well, but it barely outspeeds and threatens a likely 2HKO with Blizzard. If Venusaur is paralyzed, it becomes a lot more afraid of Pokemon like Vaporeon, Omastar, and especially Dewgong.
Moveset: Sleeper
Description: Set Description
Razor Leaf will virtually always land a critical hit, so it provides Venusaur with a reliable and powerful STAB move that gives it a key advantage over Tangela. Its base damage is higher than Raichu's Thunderbolt and even with Tentacruel's Surf. Razor Leaf will always OHKO Dugtrio and Omastar and deal well over 50% to Water-type Pokemon like Poliwrath and Dewgong. The move will also 2HKO Vaporeon 78.6% of the time, making Venusaur the only Pokemon in UU to do so reliably. Some neutral targets take hefty damage as well, with Kangaskhan and Kadabra dropping to two and three hits, respectively. Additionally, Razor Leaf's critical hits make it a very good move for taking out rare Amnesia users like Poliwrath and Golduck. Because Venusaur was unfortunately denied access to Stun Spore, it makes use of Body Slam to try to spread paralysis. This is helpful against common switch-ins like Dragonite, Tentacruel, Articuno, and Kadabra. The move is also Venusaur's best option for hitting some targets that resist Razor Leaf. Toxic prevents Dragonite from using Wrap effectively. It also happens to be Venusaur's best move against Tangela, notably shutting down variants that run Bind. Other, less common users of partial-trapping moves, like Pinsir and Moltres, also prefer to avoid Toxic, though they are more capable of fighting off Venusaur in general.
Sleep Powder is Venusaur's most significant move. Working Venusaur into battle against slower foes so it can use Sleep Powder is essential to using it effectively. Most often, Venusaur will try to somehow get in against Hypno. Most simply, Venusaur can just switch in whenever the opponent is likely to switch in a healthy Hypno. Special attackers, especially Kadabra, are quite good at baiting in Hypno; note that this can be done as early as turn 1 by leading with Kadabra. Venusaur can also come in after Hypno, or really any Pokemon, has used Rest and use Sleep Powder to catch a switch-in or put the Rest user right back to sleep. While exploiting Hypno and resting Pokemon is Venusaur's main route to success, it isn't its only one. For example, it can switch well into Dugtrio despite not quite walling it, as it can threaten an OHKO with Razor Leaf in addition to sleep. Venusaur also punishes Substitute Dugtrio exceptionally well, as Sleep Powder breaches the Substitute. Venusaur is also pretty good against Electric-type Pokemon, especially Raichu, but the threat of paralysis makes the matchup a little less desirable. It is important not to paralyze many Pokemon before Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, as many Pokemon can easily wall it once they are paralyzed. Once Venusaur has used Sleep Powder, it will usually will transition right away to using Body Slam to try to paralyze a switch-in. After that, it can serve as an answer to sleeping Water-type Pokemon or an auxiliary check to Dugtrio in the endgame. Venusaur is also fairly common sleep fodder.
Venusaur's traits make it a good teammate for several key Pokemon in the UU metagame. Leads like Kadabra and Electabuzz that goad Pokemon like Hypno and Dugtrio to switch in work very well with Venusaur, as they allow it to use Sleep Powder early on before paralysis is spread. Articuno is uniquely suited to partner with Venusaur. It appreciates Venusaur's ability to effortlessly thwart Water-type Pokemon as well as its Sleep Powder, which can make setting up Agility much easier. Articuno, in turn, does well against a lot of Pokemon that can scare or bully Venusaur, like Dragonite, Dodrio, and Tangela. Other wallbreakers and sweepers like Kangaskhan, Persian, Dodrio, and Dragonite appreciate Venusaur for similar reasons.

Overview: Victreebel got lucky in RBY OU. It lacks obvious strengths, having just decent offensive capabilities, mediocre bulk, and a lousy typing. However, Victreebel has several useful tools that allow it to exploit certain metagame trends. Thanks to its average Speed and access to Wrap and Sleep Powder, Victreebel is able to keep itself safe while bullying the tier's slowest staples, like Exeggutor, Chansey, and Snorlax. Likewise, anything paralyzed is liable to fall victim to Victreebel's repetitive Wraps. Victreebel also has a powerful Razor Leaf that can deal hefty damage to several key Pokemon, like Starmie, Slowbro, Lapras, and Rhydon, the last of which it will always OHKO. Victreebel has plenty of other toys to play with as well, such as Stun Spore and Swords Dance. These traits make Victreebel a menace against slower teams and teams that have mismanaged paralysis. It is undoubtedly one of the best Pokemon for closing games against weakened teams.
Victreebel, however, has numerous flaws that have reduced it to more of a niche threat than a tier staple in recent times. In the modern metagame, teams are typically much faster than they were in the past and leads like Starmie, Alakazam, and Jynx are more inclined to switch early on and dodge paralysis. While Chansey is very likely to become paralyzed over the course of the game, Victreebel may find it difficult to pressure anything else, and its mere presence is often an invitation for fast Psychic-type Pokemon. Additionally, the slight decrease in Exeggutor usage has been to Victreebel's detriment. Although the two compete as sleepers, Exeggutor's reduced role in the metagame has contributed to faster teams and reduced the presence of a prime Pokemon Victreebel can dominate with Sleep Powder or Wrap. Other more general issues include Victreebel's horrendous weaknesses to Ice and Psychic, vulnerability to paralysis, inability to threaten Gengar, and poor consistency, due to the imperfect accuracy of virtually every move it uses, most notably Wrap. Finally, while its defensive stats are somewhat workable, its mediocre Speed, poor typing, and lack of recovery make it deceptively frail; Tauros will typically KO Victreebel with a Blizzard followed by a Hyper Beam, for example.
Comments: Other Options
Body Slam is Victreebel’s most notable alternative option for either set. The decent Base Power and paralysis chance allow Victreebel to punish switch-ins without committing to moves like Stun Spore and Sleep Powder, which can potentially be blocked by a statused Pokemon or just miss. However, the middling payoff and rather high value of Victreebel’s moveslots make it a rare sight. Double-Edge can potentially be run on the Swords Dance set for additional power without risking a Hyper Beam recharge turn, but it is generally outclassed by the utility moves that give Victreebel its niche. Toxic is another possible option on the standard set because it pairs well with Wrap, causing damage to accumulate much more quickly. Once again, however, Victreebel seldom has room to run a move like this.
Checks and Counters
Paralysis: Victreebel is incapacitated by paralysis. With all of its healthy foes faster than it, Victreebel will no longer be able to use Wrap to pressure slower targets and pivot. Additionally, Wrap will hit only a mere 66% of the time once Victreebel is paralyzed, making it an inconsistent option even against paralyzed targets. Likewise, the imperfect accuracies of Razor Leaf, Hyper Beam, Sleep Powder, and Stun Spore are exacerbated by the chance for full paralysis. Pokemon like Alakazam and Starmie will typically try to use Thunder Wave to dispatch Victreebel as fast as possible, and slower Pokemon like Chansey and Exeggutor will be happy to punish any Wrap misses with Thunder Wave and Stun Spore, respectively.
Gengar: Gengar is a hard counter to Victreebel. Aside from status moves, Victreebel is incapable of threatening Gengar at all, as it takes no damage from Wrap or Hyper Beam and very little from Razor Leaf. Gengar, on the other hand, can put Victreebel to sleep or quickly KO it with Night Shade or the occasional Psychic. Wrap still immobilizes Gengar despite not doing any damage, allowing Victreebel to pivot to a teammate, so Gengar can’t switch in entirely for free.
Flying-type Pokemon: Flying-type Pokemon tend to be strong answers to Victreebel. Zapdos is by far the most common and can easily dispatch Victreebel with Thunder Wave or 2HKO it with Drill Peck. Unless Victreebel is partnered with Rhydon or Golem, Zapdos is very likely to claim a KO if it gets the chance to face Victreebel. Articuno and Moltres also outspeed and can 2HKO Victreebel with Blizzard and Fire Blast, respectively. All three Pokemon also have impressive bulk, so they can survive even a +2 Hyper Beam if necessary. Dragonite is also a rather sturdy check, as it shrugs off most of Victreebel’s moves and can inhibit it with Thunder Wave or its own Wrap.
Psychic and Ice-type Moves: Psychic and Ice-type moves deal hefty damage to Victreebel, typically scoring a 2HKO. Alakazam, Starmie, and Jynx all outspeed Victreebel and can 2HKO it with Psychic or Blizzard. Slower Pokemon can also harshly punish misses and poor switches from Victreebel. Exeggutor and Lapras both score 2HKOs with their super effective STAB moves, though the latter takes a lot from Razor Leaf. Chansey can also get a 3HKO with Ice Beam. Cloyster is an incredibly awkward matchup, as the two Speed tie and 2HKO each other with their STAB moves, with Victreebel potentially getting the KO outright if Cloyster has sustained even the slightest chip damage.
Faster Pokemon: Victreebel has difficulty threatening Pokemon faster than it, as it typically cannot stay in and use Wrap safely. Essentially every common Pokemon faster than Victreebel has the potential to simply wait out Victreebel’s Wrap turns, provided it doesn't switch out, and eventually punish it with a super effective attack or paralysis. Victreebel can typically weaken these Pokemon before going down, such as hitting Starmie with Razor Leaf or Tauros with Stun Spore, but these matchup are generally losing for Victreebel overall.
Moveset: Standard
Description: Set Description
Thanks to its middling Speed, Victreebel can threaten about half of the tier with Sleep Powder. In general, Victreebel is most effective as a sleeper when it can get in against a slower foe with minimal risk. For example, when Chansey is likely to use Soft-Boiled or Snorlax is about to wake up from Rest, Victreebel can usually sneak in and use Sleep Powder. Likewise, if a Pokemon such as Exeggutor or Slowbro is likely to come in, Victreebel can usually find an entry point. From there, Victreebel can pivot with Wrap or pressure slower Pokemon like Snorlax with Razor Leaf and Wrap. While going for sleep early on is a viable strategy, Victreebel frequently shines late-game, as revealing it too early may make paralyzing some of your opponent's faster Pokemon more difficult. Therefore, Sleep Powder is often an endgame tool that it can use to threaten Tauros and other common endgame Pokemon. Wrap makes Victreebel a capable pivot and occasional sweeper; it can use the move to quickly get its teammates great matchups with little risk. For example, using Wrap against Chansey can provide entrance for Snorlax and using it against Exeggutor can provide entrance for Cloyster. Faster Pokemon are also vulnerable; if a foe like Alakazam, Starmie, or Zapdos tries to switch into Wrap and threaten paralysis, then a teammate like Snorlax, Jolteon, or Rhydon can come in for free. Finally, if the opposing team is made entirely slower than Victreebel, either by KOing or paralyzing every faster Pokemon, Victreebel can gradually chip away the team's health with Wrap until it can pick foes off with its attacks or swap out to a sweeper like Tauros to finish the job. Razor Leaf is Victreebel's strongest STAB move and primary attacking move. Water- and Rock-type Pokemon typically fold after just a hit or two, allowing Victreebel to reliably force switches when facing Pokemon like paralyzed Starmie, paralyzed or Resting Cloyster, Slowbro, and Rhydon. In the case of Slowbro, Razor Leaf's near-guaranteed critical hit enables Victreebel to deal hefty damage regardless of how many times it has used Amnesia. Victreebel's ability to pressure both Starmie and Rhydon is fairly unique and one of the key traits that allowed it to rise to OU. Victreebel's last move is its least important and most flexible. Stun Spore improves Victreebel's utility with Wrap and gives it the ability to pressure faster Pokemon even after Sleep Clause has taken effect. This is especially potent when the opponent's only Pokemon faster than Victreebel is Tauros. Hyper Beam makes Victreebel a more effective sweeper in late-game scenarios, picking up early KOs on Pokemon like Chansey and Alakazam.
Depending on how Victreebel is played, it has a number of strong potential teammates. Starmie and Rhydon are typical partners, as they create a potent offensive core. Starmie can stymie Pokemon that threaten Victreebel like Alakazam, Jynx, Cloyster, and Articuno, while Victreebel can take advantage of Starmie’s ability to spread paralysis by using Wrap and applying pressure to Starmie’s strongest check, Chansey. Rhydon rounds out the core by handling Electric-type Pokemon, particularly Zapdos, which heavily threaten both Starmie and Victreebel. Rhydon also benefits from paralysis spread by these allies. Electric-type Pokemon also tend to work well with Victreebel on offensive teams, as Wrap can be a valuable tool for allowing them to switch in safely; Zapdos and Jolteon are quite good at finishing off a team that has been chipped by Wrap. Victreebel can also punish the switches to Rhydon or Golem that Electric-type Pokemon tend to encourage. Victreebel is also a fixture of Wrap teams. While a less common strategy in competitive play, Victreebel can be paired with Pokemon such as Cloyster and Dragonite to easily maintain momentum and annihilate paralyzed teams. Due to the many free switches generated by Wrap, such teams often feature multiple fast offensive Pokemon such as Tauros, Zapdos, Jolteon, and Alakazam.

Description: Set Description
While Victreebel often gets the most value from a utility set based around pivoting and spreading status, it can make use of a Swords Dance set. Victreebel boasts an above-average Attack stat and can secure many important KOs after a Swords Dance. Frailer Pokemon such as Alakazam and Jynx drop to a single +2 Hyper Beam and Chansey will drop from full health about 17.9% of the time. Thanks to its decent Speed tier, Victreebel can severely weaken or outright sweep a team with Swords Dance after only a little chip damage and paralysis. Razor Leaf complements Hyper Beam quite well, as it threatens many of the most physically bulky Pokemon in the tier, such as Rhydon, Cloyster, and Slowbro. The final move on the set largely comes down to team structure and personal preference. Wrap remains useful as a pseudo-pivot move and can help Victreebel get a little more chip damage on a Pokemon to bring it into range of Hyper Beam or Razor Leaf. Sleep Powder helps Victreebel find turns to set up with Swords Dance and punish Pokemon that might be brought in to stop a sweep, like Tauros or Electric-type Pokemon. Stun Spore acts similarly, heavily punishing common late-game switch-ins. While paralysis is generally weaker than sleep, Stun Spore has a case over Sleep Powder, as it is not inhibited by Sleep Clause and can be used at any point in the match. Moreover, because Victreebel is often best at switching in and setting up on Pokemon that are already asleep, Sleep Powder may be redundant.
While Victreebel can succeed with this set, it has several notable limitations. Victreebel’s poor typing, underwhelming bulk, and vulnerability to paralysis make setting up quite difficult, forcing Victreebel to rely on free turns from sleep and risky double switches. Victreebel needs a lot of support to not only set up with Swords Dance, but also to weaken the opposing team enough that Victreebel can do real damage. This generally means all Psychic-type Pokemon on the opposing team need to be paralyzed and hard walls like Gengar need to be eliminated. Finally, while Victreebel is arguably the best user of Swords Dance in the tier, it is not necessarily the best fit for every team. Pokemon like Sandslash, Kingler, Venusaur, Pinsir, and Kabutops all offer a variety of positive traits and give Victreebel pretty stiff competition for an already niche role.

Format: PU
Overview: Vileplume's good bulk, resistance to Water- and Electric-type coverage, and access to Sleep Powder and Stun Spore let it find a comfortable spot in the PU metagame as a bulky status spreader, threatening tier staples such as Staryu and Nidoqueen with a debilitating status condition. Its Grass typing allows it to switch into and check Seaking lacking Blizzard and wall Staryu lacking Psychic or Blizzard, which is a common sight, as Surf + Thunderbolt Staryu is the most common set. Its bulk is good enough to avoid a 2HKO from super effective coverage moves, such as from Nidoqueen, Gastly, Seaking, and Staryu. Vileplume isn't too bad off in the damage department either, having access to the combination of Swords Dance and Hyper Beam to boost its already respectable Attack and get switch-ins into range of popular revenge killers such as Fearow and Staryu.
However, Vileplume is weighed down by weaknesses to common foes such as Fearow, Fire-types, and Drowzee, being outsped by the first two and 2HKOed by all three. Its matchups versus Arcanine and Fearow are particularly poor, as they can shake off the Speed drop from paralysis with Agility and take paltry damage from all of Vileplumes unboosted attacks, with even +2 Hyper Beam only 2HKOing them both. It's also completely unable to meaningfully damage Gastly, which outspeeds it and can either put it to sleep with Hypnosis or 3HKO it with Psychic. Vileplume's Speed is also incredibly mediocre, only outspeeding Drowzee, Graveler, Omanyte, and unboosted Porygon. This, in tandem with its weaknesses to many common attacking types, makes it hard for Vileplume to effectively attack despite its good bulk.
Comments: Other Options
Mega Drain can be used in place of Stun Spore to OHKO Graveler 53.8% of the time and 2HKO the uncommon Omanyte, which otherwise wall Vileplume. It also 3HKOes Staryu and 4HKOes Seaking. However, the cost of giving up Stun Spore makes Mega Drain generally unadvised. Body Slam can be used in place of Stun Spore or Hyper Beam, as it can still spread paralysis and does not risk a recharge turn. However, this is less consistent than Stun Spore and far less damaging than Hyper Beam, and Vileplume doesn't usually get enough turns on the field to make the most out of the lack of recharge. Body Slam also can't paralyze Normal-types, which is awful for Vileplume, as they can set up Agility while Vileplume can do next to nothing in return. A set consisting of dual status, Body Slam, and Mega Drain can be used, but this is generally ill-advised, as it lacks firepower and does pitiful damage to Fire-types and Fearow, though they despise status. Weepinbell outclasses Vileplume as an attacker with Grass STAB thanks to its access to Razor Leaf.
Checks and Counters
Gastly: Although Gastly hates getting statused, it completely walls Vileplume, as it's immune to Hyper Beam. Gastly can comfortably 3HKO it with Psychic in return or retaliate with Hypnosis.
Fire-types: Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar 2HKO Vileplume with Fire Blast, with Rapidash being able to chip it down with Fire Spin into Fire Blast KO range if need be. Vileplume only usually ends up getting one +2 Hyper Beam versus them before going down. However, Rapidash and Magmar are hamstrung by paralysis, and Arcanine also dislikes it.
Fearow: Fearow 2HKOes Vileplume with Drill Peck and can use Agility to set up on Vileplume and cancel out the Speed drop from paralysis. Vileplume's only way of dealing any meaningful damage back is through a +2 Hyper Beam. Fearow has to set up Agility on the turn before it KOes Vileplume or Vileplume can reapply its Speed drop. However, this ruins Fearow as a revenge killer later, forcing it to stay in and trade versus foes such as Nidoqueen or Arcanine.
Psychic-types: Drowzee and the uncommon Abra both cleanly 2HKO Vileplume with Psychic; the former takes paralysis decently well, and the latter outspeeds it. However, Abra is ruined by paralysis and is almost OHKOed by an unboosted Hyper Beam, and Drowzee is vulnerable to being put to sleep because of Vileplume's higher Speed.
Ice- and Psychic-type Coverage: Pokemon sporting Ice-type coverage, such as Nidoqueen, Blizzard variants of Seaking and Staryu, and Dragonair can 3HKO Vileplume, though all of these foes must be wary of status moves. Staryu with Psychic also rarely 3HKOes Vileplume and can potentially drop its Special to guarantee the 3HKO.
Moveset: Bulky Status Spreader
Description: <h5>Set Description</h5>
Dual status is Vileplume's bread and butter combo, letting it induce sleep on an opposing Pokemon with Sleep Powder then paralyze the switch-in with Stun Spore for a powerful one-two punch. Vileplume can either use Swords Dance in front of a sleeping foe or Stun Spore immediately to predict an incoming foe, as the threat of Swords Dance is usually enough to force a sleeping Pokemon out. +2 Hyper Beam does good damage to all Pokemon barring Gastly and Rock-types, letting Vileplume get foes into range of a strong revenge killer such as Fearow, Nidoqueen, or Staryu. Swords Dance also has the benefit of reapplying the foe's Speed drop from paralysis, letting paralyzed Vileplume outspeed faster paralyzed foes and preventing the foe from using Agility to ignore the Speed drop.
Vileplume needs support to handle Fearow, Fire-types, and Graveler effectively. Rock-types such as Graveler and Omanyte make good partners with Vileplume, as they can both wall Fearow, with the latter also walling Fire-types. However, this combination is extremely weak to Nidoqueen and Blizzard users. Blizzard Seaking also makes a great partner to Vileplume, as Vileplume can switch into Surf + Thunderbolt Staryu and incapacitate it with status, letting Seaking sweep unhindered later on, and Seaking helps handle Fire and Rock-types. Vileplume also makes a good partner to Staryu, as it can paralyze faster Pokemon that could give Staryu issues, such as Fearow and Arcanine. It also gets many Pokemon into Staryu's KO range with +2 Hyper Beam. Vileplume can use its status spreading capabilities to support and clear the way for wallbreakers and cleaners such as Nidoqueen and Fearow. Vileplume also helps support slower wallbreakers, such as Graveler.

While its Speed is poor, it still outpaces notable foes like Drowzee, Porygon, Omanyte, and Graveler; the latter two are OHKOed by Weepinbell's Razor Leaf. However, besides these useful applications, Weepinbell has few other positives to it.
While it can eke out some defensive utility using its Water and Electric resistances against Seaking and some Staryu, Weepinbell is a huge defensive liability owing to its bad bulk and typing. Its awful Fire, Flying, Psychic, and Ice weaknesses mean it gets demolished by common threats like Rapidash, Arcanine, Fearow, Gastly, and Nidoqueen. Its poor Speed adds to its woes, usually leaving it outsped and forced to take a hit before doing anything. To make matters worse, while its Razor Leaf destroys threats weak to it, it doesn't do enough damage to save it against neutral targets like Nidoqueen, and it struggles to deal notable damage to Grass-resistant Pokemon like Rapidash, Pinsir, Gastly, and Fearow.
Weepinbell also has heavy competition from other status spreaders. Drowzee may be slower, but its Thunder Wave is more reliable and its Psychic-typing grants it both a better offensive and defensive presence. While Vileplume is even less offensively threatening than Weepinbell, its enormous bulk lets it spread status more effectively. Thus, despite the fact that Weepinbell is almost impossible to reliably check without taking status, it offers little else, and thus other status spreaders should be considered before it.
Comments: Other Options
Swords Dance combined with Double-Edge makes Weepinbell much more threatening, but its offensive prowess is still subpar, and Weepinbell has to give up valuable utility to fit those moves.
Checks and Counters
Fire-types: Rapidash, Arcanine, and Magmar take minimal damage from Weepinbell's Razor Leaf and can 2HKO it with Fire Blast. Rapidash and the rare Flareon can even chip Weepinbell with Fire Spin, only needing one or two hits to get it into KO range.
Faster Attackers: Abra outspeeds Weepinbell and 2HKOes it with Psychic while also threatening it with Thunder Wave. Nidoqueen outspeeds and almost always 2HKOes Weepinbell with Blizzard or Fire Blast and is only 3HKOed by Razor Leaf.
Grass-resistant Foes: While Gastly almost never 2HKOes Weepinbell with Psychic, it resists Razor Leaf and is immune to Wrap, letting it stonewall Weepinbell. Fearow outspeeds and 2HKOes Weepinbell with Drill Peck while taking negligible damage from Razor Leaf. Pinsir resists Razor Leaf and outspeeds and 2HKOes Weepinbell with Slash.
Moveset: Double Powder
Description: Set Description
Sleep Powder and Stun Spore let Weepinbell spread sleep and paralysis. Wrap lets Weepinbell pivot around and wear down slower threats, such as Porygon, Drowzee, and paralyzed foes. Stun Spore and Wrap form a potent combination if Weepinbell can remain unparalyzed. Razor Leaf is Weepinbell's primary STAB attack and notably lets it OHKO Staryu, Graveler, and Omanyte, as well as the rarer Slowpoke and Poliwag. Razor Leaf also 2HKOes other Grass-weak targets, like Seaking.
Weepinbell has horrible matchups against Fire-types and Fearow, so Omanyte is an essential partner for its ability to switch into them. In return, Weepinbell can status Porygon, which otherwise would stonewall Omanyte. Gastly and Abra also give Weepinbell a good deal of trouble, so Drowzee is useful for its ability to check them. Pinsir can 2HKO Weepinbell with its powerful Slash, so Fire-types and Fearow make good teammates to help Weepinbell handle it. Nidoqueen is another problematic matchup, but it can be checked by Machamp and Porygon.
Weepinbell's most potent tool is Sleep Powder, so it's often best that players try to get Weepinbell on the field as quickly as possible to get an early lead. It must be wary of using Wrap recklessly, as it can let opposing players burn sleep turns with little risk. While threats like Rapidash and Gastly despise Weepinbell's status, it can't threaten them otherwise, so it's reliant on its team to get past these threats. Weepinbell hates getting paralyzed, as it renders its Wrap useless and leaves it outsped by Drowzee and Omanyte, though in some instances it's worth it, such as if Weepinbell trades paralysis with Porygon.

Format: PU
Overview: Despite its solid bulk, decent coverage, and access to Explosion, Weezing struggles to find a place in PU. Its Poison typing grants weaknesses to common Ground- and Psychic-type attacks and lacks useful resistances. Its low Speed and average attacking stats make it very easy to overwhelm, often forcing it to use Explosion early. While its Explosion is difficult to switch into, it's severely held back by Weezing's difficulty in threatening Gastly and Graveler, which can effortlessly switch in and absorb any of Weezing's attacks. To make matters worse, Weezing is largely outclassed by Muk. Weezing's higher physical bulk and Speed are generally less useful than Muk's higher Attack, which allows it to threaten KOs against more foes. Notably, Muk's Explosion is guaranteed to OHKO Fearow and Dragonair, while Weezing's is just a range; Muk also has higher odds to OHKO Porygon and Rapidash. Muk itself is on the verge of unviability, so being a generally worse Pokemon makes Weezing have an even harder time.

Moveset: Mixed Attacker
Description: Fire Blast 2HKOes Pinsir, 3HKOes Vileplume, and threatens burn on physical attackers, like Machamp and Nidoqueen. It is also generally Weezing's most spammable attack. Thunderbolt lets Weezing hit Water- and Flying-types super effectively, notably 2HKOing Staryu and Fearow. Hyper Beam lets it finish off weakened threats and has a 48.7% chance to OHKO Abra. Explosion is the primary reason to use Weezing—it has a chance to OHKO common checks like Rapidash, Dragonair, and Porygon and does a minimum of 64.4% to Nidoqueen.
Weezing is walled by Gastly and Graveler, so checks to them, such as Abra and Drowzee for the former, and Porygon for the latter, are appreciated. Nidoqueen is another troublesome matchup, so Machamp is a useful partner. Weezing faces heavy competition from Muk, so to justify using it you must utilize its few advantages, notably its better Speed in the Machamp matchup.

Format: NU
Overview: Wigglytuff is entirely outclassed by Clefable in NU. However, Clefable is one of the best Pokemon available, and Wigglytuff can do many of the same things, so Wigglytuff can be used alongside it as a second, more limited Clefable. Compared to Clefable, Wigglytuff has equally strong STAB moves and similar utility in Thunder Wave but slightly less bulk and very weak coverage moves due to its poor Special stat. In particular, Wigglytuff can be used as a response to the opposing Clefable, or in some cases as a response to Mr. Mime, allowing your own Clefable to be used for other things rather than being locked into a Clefable mirror. However, devoting a slot to Wigglytuff comes at a significant cost, since NU is an extremely centralized metagame. Using Wigglytuff leaves you with an overall slower team and generally means forgoing either Charizard or a different late-game sweeper, such as Seadra, Raticate, Electrode, or Kingler. Wigglytuff performs quite consistently when it is used, but the limitations it imposes on teambuilding are not always worth it.
Comments: Other Options
Bubble Beam provides a guaranteed 2HKO on Golem and a 33% Speed drop chance, but dropping Body Slam for Bubble Beam leaves Wigglytuff without a good move to threaten Nidoking; dropping Seismic Toss for Bubble Beam leaves Wigglytuff walled by Kabutops. Counter can potentially deal massive damage; however, Wigglytuff's opportunities to use Counter are typically limited to specific Pokemon such as Raticate, Wigglytuff, and rare targets like Primeape and Pinsir. Clefable does more damage to it with Blizzard than Body Slam anyway, and Wigglytuff does not force many switches. Thunderbolt can be used to avoid Blastoise’s Counter, 3HKO Kabutops, and rarely 2HKO Kingler; however, if Kabutops switches into either Body Slam or Hyper Beam, then Seismic Toss will 3HKO it, making it comparable to Thunderbolt. Wigglytuff is also not too threatened by Blastoise’s Counter due to its high HP stat, taking less than 50% from a Counter on Seismic Toss. Sing is a potential option, but it is not a very good one due to its 55% accuracy and Wigglytuff’s abysmal Speed. However, since Wigglytuff can be effective enough with just Thunder Wave, Seismic Toss, and Hyper Beam, Sing can be used in the fourth moveslot for niche matchups, such as against opposing Wigglytuff, and as a desperation play in an otherwise losing game.
Checks and Counters
Ground-types: Nidoking can switch into Wigglytuff's Thunder Wave and usually defeat it, outspeeding and 3HKOing it with Earthquake while avoiding a 2HKO from any combination of moves. However, Nidoking does not want to switch into Body Slam or Blizzard. Conversely, Golem has little to fear from a Body Slam + Seismic Toss Wigglytuff and can similarly switch into its Thunder Wave, but it risks losing the Speed tie and being 2HKOed by Blizzard.
Fire-types: Wigglytuff is 3HKOed by any STAB Fire Blast, aside from Moltres's which usually 2HKOes. A burn also makes Wigglytuff unable to use its STAB Hyper Beam effectively. However, Fire-types generally hate being paralyzed by Thunder Wave.
Rock-types: Kabutops can switch into Hyper Beam and take advantage of the recharge turn to either boost with Swords Dance or simply KO a weakened Wigglytuff, depending on the situation. Golem can also switch into Hyper Beam and either set up a Substitute or attack with Earthquake.
Sleep: Because of its poor Speed, Wigglytuff can be vulnerable to Pokemon with sleep-inducing moves, such as Venomoth or even Sing Clefable. However, sleep inducers do not want to switch into Thunder Wave, and Venomoth does not want to switch into Body Slam.
Moveset: Bulky Support
Description: Thunder Wave should always be used to help compensate for Wigglytuff's poor Speed and to ensure Charizard cannot set up in front of it, as Wigglytuff cannot 2HKO it. It is also generally useful due to the fast pace of matches, and it gives a bulky Pokemon, such as Wigglytuff itself, extra chances to get an advantage from full paralysis. STAB Hyper Beam is by far Wigglytuff’s most powerful move; it has a decent chance to KO Mr. Mime after a Body Slam or Seismic Toss, it is generally a good option against weakened foes, and it is a good final attack right before Wigglytuff is KOed. Seismic Toss is Wigglytuff’s most spammable move, 3HKOing Mr. Mime and 4HKOing everything other than opposing Wigglytuff. Due to Wigglytuff’s middling Attack, poor Special, and low critical hit rate, alternative moves aside from Hyper Beam rarely deal significantly more damage anyway. Seismic Toss also helps to ensure Wigglytuff does not become useless if burned.
Body Slam is often the preferred fourth move, enabling Wigglytuff to threaten Nidoking with paralysis and providing a second spammable move alongside Seismic Toss, making Wigglytuff less predictable. In particular, being able to use Body Slam to threaten paralysis rather than depending on Thunder Wave makes it more difficult for Nidoking to switch in for free. On the other hand, using a Body Slam + Seismic Toss set makes the Golem matchup difficult, since Golem is immune to Thunder Wave, Speed ties Wigglytuff, and avoids a 3HKO from Seismic Toss even after a Body Slam. Blizzard is Wigglytuff’s best coverage option for Golem without compromising the Nidoking matchup; it 2HKOes Golem about half the time, and it also deals 38% minimum to Nidoking, leaving it in range of Blastoise’s Surf or Mr. Mime’s Psychic. However, note that Blizzard does minimal damage against neutral targets due to Wigglytuff’s poor Special, so it leaves Wigglytuff very reliant on Seismic Toss.
Wigglytuff can be used as a lead, since it has a very favorable matchup against Mr. Mime and an acceptable matchup against Charizard while preventing Venomoth from switching in safely due to Thunder Wave and STAB Body Slam. Alternatively, Clefable can be used in the lead slot for its ability to 2HKO Charizard with Blizzard and similarly favorable Mr. Mime matchup, and it can also use Psychic to threaten Venomoth; in this case, Wigglytuff should be used to provide the team with a bulky Thunder Wave user and Clefable check. Outside of the lead, Wigglytuff is typically best used as a Clefable switch-in, after which it can paralyze it with Thunder Wave and trade hits with Seismic Toss or Body Slam. Wigglytuff can also switch into a predicted Seismic Toss or Thunder Wave from Mr. Mime, but Wigglytuff does not want to switch into Mr. Mime's Psychic, as it can be 2HKOed with one critical hit.
